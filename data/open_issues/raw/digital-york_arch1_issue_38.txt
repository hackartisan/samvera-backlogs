Searching the database
Our project supervisor, Prof Sarah Rees-Jones has just identified a problem with searching the database and hoped you might be able to help fix it. Here is what happened: I searched for the text string Merk*  but the system also returned mer* (so several cameras etc) - as in the example below (the letters between two sets of asterisks). However it did not return all mer* by any means. Merk* produced 7 results including the odd ones. Mer* produced 743 results. I do note that â€˜Markenfield' usually occurred elsewhere in these odd merk* results - but it still makes no sense to me since those are not highlighted and in any case do not include the string merk* (I was deliberately searching on the medieval spelling.) Register 8 f.298 (verso) entry 1 Entry Type: | Certification Section Type: | Intrinseca Camere Summary: Certification to the pope, having received his letter, that John de Markenfield, canon of York, and John Fraunceys, clerk, had been cited by Henry Willelmi of Ardsley, notary public, to appear before the pope.

I don't think the system supports search keywords followed by a '*'. The only case is to search '*' itself which returns all results. To find 'Merk', just type 'Merk' in the search box. Hope it makes sense. @NorthernWay1
