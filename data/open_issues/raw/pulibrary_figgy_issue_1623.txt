We handle the multiple scripts for our islamic manuscripts, but they've always been imported - and I don't think we do anything with sub titles?  A lot of these are handled in Ephemera - I wonder if we should migrate that way? We'd just have to figure out how to move over extent, type (although I think LAE has this modeled as "genre"), and handle multiple scripts.
@joycebcat Was the "collection of ephemera has a MARC record" just a practice from the past?
@tpendragon No.  We still do cross-over records in the catalog at the collection-level for a number of things whose detailed access is provided elsewhere.
@joycebcat Alright. We shouldn't need to hook that marc record to anything in Figgy though yeah?
@tpendragon Correct.  In figgy each bit of ephemera is going to have its own data.
This adds the requirement that sometimes a title will have a subtitle associated with it, meaning at times a title will be a nested object and we'll need some UI for like "+ subtitle"
Discussion of the title / subtitle wireframes led to discussion of linking titles with their transliterations. The titles in the mets different scripts are linked via `altRepGroup`. This means that data exists linking a given title and its transliteration. We need to know whether that link must be preserved. If so, we need to do additional modeling and wireframe work here. See slack discussion in #digital_library from this day for more background / info.
