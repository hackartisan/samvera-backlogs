Fix Zotero web extension
Note from user testing on 2/13/18: I user tested with someone who uses the Zotero web extension. His workflow is not to click the export button on any given page, but instead to use the Zotero shortcut button in the top right of his Chrome browser. When he did so, he was confused by the lack of information (no date, no author) and incorrect information (saying it was a website instead of a photograph or manuscript). Then when he used the "export RIS" button and imported the file into the Zotero desktop, he was surprised to find extra information, all correct, and appearing where he wanted it. He was wondering if this happens to him all the time using the Zotero web extension and if he's just never noticed that he's losing so much information or not. He said it works really well with Amazon, which is where he pulls most of his book citations. Here is the screenshot:
