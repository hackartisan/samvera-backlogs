Document how to get in touch with us, who to talk to, how to find out about updates, how to send in requests. What repository should I make a ticket on?

We can use materials prepared for github presentation as a starting point. outline: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GkWgdb5ejYGRUyM-hN6aw-lVrNxW7_4HqaxCeVAX7TM/edit list of repos: https://docs.google.com/document/d/186557Xho16dxWTVXcNI09sSINfIM-NJx8yqVAljeJgI/edit presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VJvo_zbfc0KXRi9_MqM0VdPX2iSVWkNCFzjaFp_uq9o/edit#slide=id.p
