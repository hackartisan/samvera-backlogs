can't batch add shared works to collection
I can't batch add works shared with me to a collection using my usual workflow of collection page --> add works --> check boxes of multiple works in "my works" --> add to collection --> select work from list --> save Trying this workflow but clicking on "shared with me" instead of selecting from "my works" does not give me the option to add to collection at the top of the page. The only button available once you start selecting shared works is "edit" instead of the expected "edit," "delete selected," and "add to collections" buttons. Some of these works were ingested after the admin permissions fix. I can, however, add shared works to a collection one a time in the relationships tab.
Okay, rebooted my dev environment, now I can succesfully save things to collection following that script -- can't reproduce.  Also couldn't reproduce in staging.  I may be an 'admin' where sarah is not though, may depend on exact permissions involved.   @archivistsarah Can you tell me:  * What your login/email address is on production (sorry I should prob know) * Which specific collection you were trying to add to, in case the error depends on collection (if multiple pick one) * Example work that you tried to add * Confirm, what went wrong is simply that the works were _not_ added to the collection, and you received no error message?  Thanks!
snewhouse@chemheritage.org (pretty sure I'm a admin on prod & an owner of the collection)  Beckman Historical Collection: https://hydra.chemheritage.org/collections/wh246s128  I wasn't trying to add anything specific -- just to batch add all the works shared with me that were not previously part of this collection. Here's an example: https://hydra.chemheritage.org/concern/generic_works/8w32r621f  What's "wrong" (may be a feature not a bug) is that the UX doesn't give you a button to add shared works. If you're adding works you are the owner of via the the workflow I described, you usually see an "add to collection" button at the top of the works list. That button is absent if you're looking at the "shared with me" works list.   I *can* add shared-with-me works to that collection one at a time though, through edit-->relationships, so I don't think it's just a permissions issue.
Oh I misunderstood the nature of the bug. Okay, thanks.   I suspect this is just the way sufia is designed. Perhaps we can enhance it. 
this is no longer an immediate concern (& it only was for me getting accurate stats/reports). Everything shared with me that I was trying to put into the Beckman collection was owned by Megan, and she was able to put everything into the collection 50 works at at time.   might still be something we want going forward though.
Thanks, @archivistsarah! Good workaround. I'm moving this to the backlog; anyone who needs this more urgently should comment.
