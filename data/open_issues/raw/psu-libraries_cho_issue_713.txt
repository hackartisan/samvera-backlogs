Search Bar Autocomplete and Screen Reader(s)
Putting a ref to projectblacklight/blacklight#1907 so that I remember to fix this upstream.
Do we want autocomplete? And if so do we want the autocomplete provided by Blacklight if it is fixed? Or do we want to implement autocomplete in another way?   Related https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/issues/1907
