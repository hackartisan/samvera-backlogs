UC Research Directory integration (epic)
This is an epic issue to track and discuss the ways that Scholar can integrate with Research Directory Potential integrations Use RS API to populate Scholar profile pages  Original issue on scholar_uc_legacy: uclibs/scholar_uc_legacy#19 API Documentation : https://systest.ahctest.uc.edu/eprof/cfc/fetcheprofdatadoc.cfc?method=getdocumentation Example of API return on a 6+2 query: https://git.uc.edu/UCLIBS/api-documentation/blob/master/research_directory/get_wb_page_data-sample-formatted.xml  Use Scholar to store content uploaded to Research Directory  Create an ingest API that can be used by RS Users in RS would see a direct link to the file stored in Scholar

Minimal set of components for ingesting a file into Scholar * UC login (and an established user object in Rails database) * Select a work type * Metadata     * Title     * Creator (multiple)     * College     * Program/Department     * Description     * License     * Advisor (multiple) - Student Works, ETDs     * Degree Program - ETDs * Select visibility * Read and agree to distribution license * Upload file    
Adding Chuck's notes from the 2019-03-21 meeting:  ## Research Directory Integration Meeting Glen recaped phone call describing initial workflow discussed, allowing researchers to store files in scholar, be served from scholar.  Described how scholar stores files in Fedora + Isolon.  Minimum set of metadata is required for ingesting a work into scholar.  Mark described the intent of store media in research directory, RD is really only interested in having a link to the media being described, upload is for people who don't have a place to link to.  Josette proposed a new type in research directory for works stored in scholar.  Robert asked about using message queues to get around async breakdowns.  Currently infrastructure does not exist to support message queuing.  Mark suggested an innerstitial approach with all scholar related fields that kicks of the message queue.  Sean suggested a Javascript modal that pulls information from reasearch directory page, validates that all required metadata is present.  Glen explained authentication hurdles, passing sessions between research directory and scholar.  Suggested giving an API key to research directory, allowing them to make desposits on users behalf without them being logged in.  Robert suggests uploading files from research directory to a shared Isolon bucket.  Glen asked about uploading multiple items to research directory: RD supports one attachment at a time.  Timeline discussion: no current timeframe set on either side, Robert said better idea in a week.  Thomas suggests diagramming system.  Research directory is working through changing over from CLS to shibboleth.  However, research directory allows Cincinnati Children's users to sign in, they would not have a 6+2 username.  We would need to create local accounts for them.  Room consensus seems to be to only show scholar upload option if they are UC 6+2 holders.  First step is to set up an API.  Suggested Message Queing Platforms 1.
