Clean up isPartOf content
Member vantuyls commented on May 22 Some content that moved from DSpace to Hydra used the mythical predicate isPartOfSeries and was, largely, a combination of Journal Title, Volume, and Number. We forewent cleaning this up pre-migration (because there wasn't a place to put the Volume and Number values in DSpace) in favor of cleaning these up post-migration. SO: in the spreadsheet linked below, please clean up the metadata by separating Journal Title, Volume, Number and any additional information into appropriate form fields. @vantuyls vantuyls added the Post-Migration Work label on May 22 @vantuyls vantuyls referenced this issue on May 22 Closed Create spreadsheet of dspace items wiht ispartofseries #37 0 of 2 tasks complete @mlv611 mlv611 commented on May 22 @vantuyls Where is the spreadsheet? @vantuyls Member vantuyls commented on May 23 it hasn't been created yet. @zhang4952 is going to generate it soon. @zhang4952 Member zhang4952 commented on May 25 â€¢ The spreadsheet is in the Google drive: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10KnwYNVvJmHohJNFDv1mh_h6wAJ6fj2Cfgl3C1jm2Go/edit?usp=sharing, there are ~21,000 items with legitimate values. It will take 'significant' effort to clean it because they are in wide spreading formats. @vantuyls @mlv611
