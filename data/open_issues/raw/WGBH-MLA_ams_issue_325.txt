Gather ids from batches to delete and reindex
Description: As an ingester, I need a set of things that need to be reingested. Details:  One file in a batch can turn into a several batch items, and if any of them fail, then we need to reingest the whole file. All of those batch items will share "id within batch" Some files may have been resubmitted in a subsequent batch. Within that batch the assets all of its children may or may not have completed or failed. The only time we want to exclude something from the reingest list is if there is a batch where all of the batch items for that file successfully complete and none of them fail.  Subtasks:   Test to determine if a file needs to be reingested.  Script to generate a list of relevant batch items
