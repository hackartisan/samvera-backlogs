Alter reindexing process for production
The 'reindex' process first drops the Solr core before iterating through all records in the repository. This should NOT be the default for production. An in-place reindex will cause less of a disruption in service.
First, while the phrase is "dropping a core", what is really happening is a `delete` is being sent to have the core delete everything in it.  Removing the delete step seems fine. I wonder if we could first list all the items in the solr core, do the index using Fedora as the source, and then remove anything from solr which was not touched. This is complicated, but it will clear out stale and deleted items from solr. (could be important in production, e.g. removing all the seaside objects from solr. Would most definitely be important in pre-prod and staging.)
