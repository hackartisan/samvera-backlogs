Stop new works being featured automatically
Any new upload seems to be added automatically to the featured works. Can we change that, please?
I can't quite reproduce it, but there is something a little strange. New upload not featured in the box: <img width="1248" alt="Screenshot 2019-04-12 at 12 55 46" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40735172/56035560-71248200-5d22-11e9-9d09-e77f9af5cf1d.png">  But  _Featured_  looks 'switched on' when you go to the details page <img width="1308" alt="Screenshot 2019-04-12 at 12 55 01" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40735172/56035685-b5178700-5d22-11e9-9a88-4f07151d7b73.png">  It's not a big thing, but it's a bit odd.
This is on Safari. Do you want me to try on Chrome as well?
No thanks, I've seen it before in Chrome. Might be a Hyrax bug.
