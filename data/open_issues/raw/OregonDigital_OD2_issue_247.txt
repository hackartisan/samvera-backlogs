oEmbed Update page should differentiate oEmbed errors
Descriptive summary Currently, the oEmbed update page always says "oEmbed URL is broken" if there is a failed oEmbed. However, in cases where the oEmbed URL is valid, but the site is not whitelisted, this error message is confusing. Expected behavior either:  change the helptext to read "oEmbed URL is broken or the site has not been whitelisted" show a different message for broken oEmbed URL and non-whitelisted site
ruby-oembed returns the same error for not whitelisted, broken-url, and no content found at url. https://github.com/ruby-oembed/ruby-oembed/blob/master/lib/oembed/providers.rb#L78 This method should allow us to differentiate between not whitelisted and the others.  Currently, verbatim error messages are passed through from ruby-oembed. These may be targeted at a more technical audience, but seem reasonable enough for admin users. Messages can be found here: https://github.com/ruby-oembed/ruby-oembed/blob/master/lib/oembed/errors.rb Since this requires creating custom messages for a specific error case, we should think if we want to overwrite these messages in a new issue.
