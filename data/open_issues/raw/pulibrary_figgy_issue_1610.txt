Ingest "Japanese maps" (pudl0092)
These don't seem to be displayed anywhere. Migrate? Ping @jpstroop @joycebcat
I think these are mostly migrated:  https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/6773431 https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/6773457 https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/6773474  @eliotjordan I'm only seeing 1 of the 8 on the middle one (6773457) â€” are the rest ingested but not linked to the right ARK, or do they need to be ingested?
I can't find them in figgy, so they probably need to be found and ingested.
