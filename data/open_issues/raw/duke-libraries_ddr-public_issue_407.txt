In search results show an item's component file types
This came up in our meeting with DVS. They showed an example of results on data.gov that display colored pills with file extensions on items. I think something like this might be useful in search results to show what an item contains.
Neat.  Might that be available via a collection-level configuration option?  It seems like it might be useful in other data collections.  It may be useful, too, as we begin formation migrations.
