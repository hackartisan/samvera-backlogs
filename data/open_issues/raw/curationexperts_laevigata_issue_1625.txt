After completely submitting ETD am able to get back in by hitting the back button
Testing on upgrade-etd.emory.edu | Â© 2017 Emory University. Version js/fix-school-dept-embargo-switching updated 13 August 2018. When I have submitted my ETD and am at the confirmation screen and I hit the back button I am brought back to the ETD - seemingly in progress. Not all info is still there.
And if I try to re-enter the files (from Box or from my files) it won't let me save and continue.
