Batch Import Preview Error Messaging Improvements
As a digital production technician building a collection, I would like to see error messages reported back on multiple levels, So that its easier for me to troubleshoot the cause of the error and fix the problem. Levels with some example errors. Not suggesting the UI should be an ordered list, just that they do relate hierarchically.  Zip errors [anything reported back by the zipping utility(ies)]  Bag errors [anything reported back by the bagging utility(ies)]  Work errors [CSV and metadata errors, missing directories for works, can't parse file sets]  File set errors [CSV and metadata errors, missing file sets, missing files]  File errors [anything reported back by a utility that rejects the file: fits or it's dependencies, solr, etc.]          Child of #788 Related: #834
