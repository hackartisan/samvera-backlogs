Adjust information in Scholar@UC to be compliant with FERPA
Moved from uclibs/scholar_uc_legacy#1896 Descriptive summary FERPA is a federal law about the privacy of student records.  https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html The UC Directory has adjusted to be compliant with FERPA -  - I think - by suppressing information for some students at the students' request. Expected behavior Email addresses, and any other protected information, for student contributors either do not display, or only display consistently with the permissions given by the student to the UC directory. Actual behavior Email addresses display on the People page  and on the individual Profile page for a student contributor.
