bibo:peerReviewed doesn't exist, look again at BIBO ontology
http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/peerReviewed which is mapped in default metadata doesn't actually exist. There is a http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/status/peerReviewed and it's counterpart http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/status/nonPeerReviewed but they're term values for I think the bibo:DocumentStatus property. The ontology is here: https://github.com/structureddynamics/Bibliographic-Ontology-BIBO/blob/master/bibo.owl
@vantuyls @simholt   Option A: Change predicate to http://dbpedia.org/ontology/isPeerReviewed in DefaultMetadata and all items with this predicate The values for that are of range xsd:boolean (one of 'true', 'false', 1, 0) so I think we're ok there, even though our TRUE/FALSE are capitalized  Option B: Change predicate to http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/status in DefaultMetadata and all items with this predicate Change PeerReviewed property values (TRUE/FALSE) to * http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/status/peerReviewed * http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/status/nonPeerReviewed  This would allow other Statuses defined by BIBO ('draft', 'forthcoming', 'legal', 'published', 'rejected, 'unpublished' have URIs) and any others we would want to define. The existing Peer Reviewed facet could be configured to stay as it is now, or it could be merged in to a bigger 'Document Status' one that has Peer Reviewed and Non Peer Reviewed along with the other values.
Steve said go with Option A.
@wickr please also update the MAP when you finalize this. 
@simholt @wickr if this is properly reflected on the MAP, please close this issue. 
The current thinking is that I run a job to change the predicate in Fedora in conjunction with a code update so the application knows about the property/predicate change, and our “QA” service is aware of the metadata value. The new values should be lowercase `true` and `false`.   The solution to this ticket will need to be coordinated and planned to run the Fedora update immediately after the code is pushed to production. 
We are changing the predicate to `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/isPeerReviewed` (as in Option A, with agreement as documented in this ticket in Jan 2018). The new predicate should have xsd:boolean conformant values `true` or `false`.  Aspects of this change include:  - [ ] Change predicate for existing items from `http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/peerReviewed` to `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/isPeerReviewed` - [ ] Update code with new predicate - [ ] Change values for existing items from `TRUE`/`FALSE` to `true`/`false` - [ ] Update controlled vocabulary to use lowercase values: https://github.com/osulp/Scholars-Archive/blob/master/config/authorities/peerreviewed.yml - [ ] Update MAP
Production update process;  - [ ] Tunnel to the SOLR server and query all of the works (~44k) with `peerreviewed` set : http://localhost:8983/solr/hydra-prod/select?fl=id,%20peerreviewed_tesim&indent=on&q=peerreviewed_sim:*&rows=60000&wt=csv - [ ] Rake task to iterate through each work; deleting the statement with the old predicate from the graph, setting the `peerreviewed` to lowercase value, save the work (updates Fedora and index)
