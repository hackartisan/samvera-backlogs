Download statistics by location
As a service manager, I would like to see how often items have been downloaded by users in Europe, so that I can help demonstrate the global impact of the service.
@patriciahswe & @mahirakgun: Does the Geo location report from google analytics cover this request? https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?authuser=0#report/visitors-geo/a33252017w60487619p61852754/ 
@awead I realized that data is for views.  Is there a way to look at the downloads by country in GA? 
I found the ability to see downloaded Event Action as a secondary dimension of the report: https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?authuser=0#report/visitors-geo/a33252017w60487619p61852754/%3F_u.date00%3D20160501%26_u.date01%3D20160710%26geo-table.secSegmentId%3Danalytics.eventAction%26geo-table.plotKeys%3D%5B%5D%26geo-table.rowCount%3D50/ 
sweet!
