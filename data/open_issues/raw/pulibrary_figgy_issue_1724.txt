Structure manager thumbnails are missing for map sets
Thumbnails in the structure manager are not displaying for map sets (ScannedResources with child ScannedResources).
I can't replicate this locally. Exploring the issue on figgy-staging with rails console didn't yield any information either. I'm kind of stuck here.
