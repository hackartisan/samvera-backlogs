User profile pages should include a link to the user's Research Directory profile
(moved from uclibs/scholar_uc_legacy#18) Descriptive summary Investigate a reliable way to link to a user's Research Directory profile from their Scholar profile page. Example: On https://scholar.uc.edu/users/hortongn@ucmail-dot-uc-dot-edu?locale=en, include a link in the sidebar called "Research Directory profile" that links to https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/hortongn The format seems to be https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/<sixplus2>, but we should not assume that a page in RD exists for everyone.  So we should have a method to verify the link is resolvable before we display it. We can probably get the user's sixplus2 from their user.uid field.
