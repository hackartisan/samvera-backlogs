Allow users to batch edit works in a collection
Descriptive summary A user should be able to use Hyrax's batch edit functionality to edit metadata of all works in a collection. Users currently need to select individual works they want to batch edit.  Add the ability to select all of the works based on the collection they're in.

Questions about this one:  * Thomas's question above - should we be able to accomplish this by filtering by collection on the dashboard, and then selecting all works for batch edit?   * Note that this filter doesn't seem to work, as-is (e.g., I have a collection in my local environment, but it's only showing "Default Admin Set") * Should the batch edit support both works and sub-collections? * Do we already have support for batch-editing different classes simultaneously?
