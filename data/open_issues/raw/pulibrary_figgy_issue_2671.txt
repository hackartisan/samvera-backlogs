Create a new Google OAuth project
Figgy currently uses Google OAuth in order to provide access to Google Drive for file uploads (using Browse Everything).  This needs to be available to all developers.
I'll need to investigate whether or not this is affected by https://developers.google.com/+/api-shutdown, but I have not received any notifications that the OAuth settings for this need to be updated.
The OAuth settings used for Google Drive access do *not* to be updated for Figgy in the production or staging environments in response to the Google+ API shutdown.
