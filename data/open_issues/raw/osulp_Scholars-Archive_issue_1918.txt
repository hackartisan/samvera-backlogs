@simholt For the first 235 items, you probably want to clear all values under `alt_title` right? Right now there is a bug that prevents clearing all values in a field. PR https://github.com/osulp/Scholars-Archive/pull/1911 will fix the issue, so I'll get this one deployed to master on Monday in prep for the bulk edit.
@luisgreg99 Yes, that is correct. Thank you!
Started running bulk edit for "SA Bulk Edits 19 Aug 2019"
@simholt I've  updated `alt_title` in my copy before exporting and starting the script. With the update now in place, we can now use an empty cell (like it was done in the past) under the `to` column along with `*` under `from` to indicate that we want to clear all values in a property. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3486120/63390172-fe2bb780-c362-11e9-9356-9f90a7b9aac6.png)

Ran batch `SA_Bulk_Edits_19_Aug_2019_batch8.csv` today, but many failed due to an issue related to empty embargo history values on some works previously migrated from dspace https://github.com/osulp/Scholars-Archive/issues/1962. Made a new list with this issue at `SA_Bulk_Edits_19_Aug_2019_batch8_d.csv`. Will run this batch when https://github.com/osulp/Scholars-Archive/pull/1964 (fixes https://github.com/osulp/Scholars-Archive/issues/1962) gets merged and deployed to production.
