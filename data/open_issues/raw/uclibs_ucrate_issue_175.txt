Research multi-tenancy options
Descriptive summary Work has been done in Hyku (https://github.com/samvera-labs/hyku) to allow for a single Hyrax application to act as two separate applications.  There's a possibility we will benefit from that with the Scholar/UCrate merger.  Multi-tenancy is also helpful when using a cloud-based host (we may move some or all of our servers to AWS at some point). Explore what benefits multi-tenancy would provide for us.  How will it affect what users and content providers experience?  Is it feasible for us to implement it?  Can we get it running in a sandbox environment to play with it?
