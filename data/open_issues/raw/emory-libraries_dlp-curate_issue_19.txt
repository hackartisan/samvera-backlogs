Support future system of record integration for metadata imports
Story As a Metadata Specialist or Collection Manager, I want to migrate static metadata into the repository for its initial ingest, and then configure it to be synchronized to an external system of record later, so that I can get content into the repository while larger metadata re-use strategies are worked out Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes Configure System of Record ID in metadata properties; accommodate static copies of metadata records (e.g. MARCXML record as supplemental files as part of ingest). Relates to additional metadata extraction epics for Alma. System of Record ID Prefixes For either migrated or form-entered data, assign a consistent prefix so that we can differentiate ID numbers across external systems. Relates to comments in #91. Links to Additional Information Example form mockup - append system prefix through UI drop-down Metadata Implementation Worksheet Alma/MARC Mapping Checklist   System of Record ID: Alma records: prepend "alma:" before ID value  System of Record ID: ArchiveSpace records:prepend "aspace:" before ID value  System of Record ID: Ability to expand this set of prefixes over time as new system integrations are developed  Given/When/Then  Given (some context) and (some other optional context) When (some action is carried out) Then (a set of observable consequences should occur)
