Batch editing works uploaded before GWSS 2.0 migration
What is the appropriate means to "batch" edit items uploaded before the GWSS 2.0 migration, which are now owned by openaccess@gwu.edu? Alternative version of the same question: Is it possible to use the GWSS dashboard's "batch edit" function to edit works for works that you don't own but which you have edit rights to the Administrative Set they belong to? (The admin UI's batch edit function appears to only be available on the Works screen (https://scholarspace.library.gwu.edu/dashboard/my/works), and that screen doesn't include items in your Administrative Sets, only items that you own.)
