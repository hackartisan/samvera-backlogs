error cropping up with newspaper ingest
this is popping up on the dev server (but i don't think locally) during ingesting, i think during the characterization process (this is a ghostscript error(?)) ERROR: Unable to process JPXDecode data. Page will be missing data.
removing this from the 0.1.0 milestone because i don't think it's detrimental to a release. it's indeed happening during the characterization process and i _think_ it's an issue with pdfs generated from an adobe program: newer newspaper pdfs generated from InDesign are throwing this error rather than scanned issues.  from the sidekiq log:  ``` 2019-05-01T20:53:48.857Z 30238 TID-1eqhli CharacterizeJob JID-4a372316d1635b38d9304f94 INFO: Performing CharacterizeJob (Job ID: 7cb5cecc-d4cb-4cd5-a513-d6d898498073) from Sidekiq(default) with arguments: #<GlobalID:0x00007eff50d78ee8 @uri=#<URI::GID gid://spot/FileSet/6395w709f>>, "6395w709f/files/9547f4f5-e7ea-4519-9bce-0863b57e854d", "/var/www/spot/releases/20190501171627/tmp/ingest/newspaper_91/data/files/lafayette_newspaper_2008_02_08_OBJ.pdf"    **** ERROR: Unable to process JPXDecode data. Page will be missing data. ```  this error isn't affecting the output of newly ingested items: thumbnails are still generated + the document renders as expected in the viewer.  best i can tell it's related to redhat's version of ghostscript (see: https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=695557, though that issue is 5 years old at this point).
