Display Fields vs System Fields: Using Controlled Code when Entering Metadata
As a metadata manager, I'd like to be able to use controlled codes that are translated in the public view, So that I don't have to enter the full value each time E.g. Entering "eng" into a language field results in a value of http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/languages/eng in the stored metadata and displayed to the user as "English" in the public view.

ISO-639 for language codes. @lmballinger Do we need to use ISO-639-2 or ISO-639-3?  http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/download.asp
