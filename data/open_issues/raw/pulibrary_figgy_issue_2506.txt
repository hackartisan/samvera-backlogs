Visibility note for geo materials is incorrect
Scanned maps, vector resources, and raster resources are all indexed into Pulmap no matter what visibility value is chosen. Visibility just influences whether previews and downloads are available to users.
@eliotjordan Do you think we should just remove "Maps Portal" from the note, or do you think it would be better to remove the note entirely from the Geo resources?
I'm not sure. I think removing it entirely is the easiest option. Alternatively, the note would need to be customizable by resource type.
