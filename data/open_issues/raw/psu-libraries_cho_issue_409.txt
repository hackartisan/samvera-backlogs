Create a Curated Collection
MVP 1 includes the ability to create a curated collection. This ticket fleshes out everything after actual creation. This is an entirely new workflow and method for building collections with mixed-provenance. While this is a starting point, this will likely need to iterate further as we actually use the feature.  If necessary, content may need to be ingested to one or more Archival or Library Collections. Create new Curated Collection Add descriptive metadata to collection (coreMAP) Add admin metadata and files to collection (MOUs, project history etc.) Set visibility for collection (works in this collection do NOT inherit -- inheritance comes from home collection)  Public Authenticated Private to an individual or group of authenticated users   Add any entire Archival or Library Collection to Curated Collection (future additions to those collections should also appear in the Curated Collection without having to manually add the new work) Search CHO to find works that need to be added.  Add works via checkbox selection on search results (one or more)   Deleting a curated collection should not delete its contained works.  Related: #259
Implementation: * UI design: searching for existing works in the form and selecting them   * adding works can be a separate screen as part of multi-step form * implement the form design * ensure accessibility
