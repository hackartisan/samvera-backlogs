Develop strategy to deal with duplicated items 
There are a number of duplicate items in the system (I have a list of 20+ without trying). Some documents have conflicting rights statements and other metadata. It looks like some theses were uploaded twice so that a different affiliation could be assigned to each, such as once for Honors and once for Bioresource Research. Duplicates need to be identified, edited, and redirected.
Here's my list so far: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yBPaNHpZrIlLA5ivF8kvjpLdDG6-DUzmzSTzUKNU8nM/edit#gid=0  Next steps: - Locate other duplicates. (Have found the above ones via title searches.) - Are they true duplicates? - Which one is correct/best? - Is a worktype change needed? - What metadata corrections are needed?  Question: What about analytics?
