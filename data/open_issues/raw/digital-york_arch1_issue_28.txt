Deleted single entry
I have just been working on Register 7, folio 115 r, and it seems that I've just lost entry 1 on that side of the folio somehow - I wasn't trying to delete it or anything. This happened on Thursday, 25 July.
Still no clue why this happened, but the fix might be: 1) Find all entries by running a solr query: folio_ssim:FOLIO_ID 2) Using other entries within the same folio to find the missing entry. (it should be misplaced within another folio) 3) In Rails console, load the missing entry and update folio property manually.
The missing Entry caused a related problem for other Folios, e.g. Reg 11 f.312 v has duplicate entry 1
Yes, that's right, the second entry 1 on that folio is the missing entry from Register 7, f. 115r, entry 1 - that is so weird!

fixed manually and needs more investigation on the cause of this problem.
As reported by Marianne, the same problem happened again with Register 9B 550r and 550v
