The FAQ page has outdated information
Descriptive summary Some tweaks are needed on /faq to reflect the current version of Scholar.  One example is the term "delegates" is still used instead of "proxies."  Current users won't understand what a delegate is. Read through the FAQ and note any items that need to be updated.  Review the changes with the team and them implement them. If you can think of a frequently asked question that isn't on this page, consider adding it.  Check with Content Services to see if they have suggestions for content on this page.
Reopening this issue since we probably want to add new content to the FAQ at some point.
