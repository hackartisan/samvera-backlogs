Search behaviors with partial terms
Given I have a work with these fields: Title: snapshot.jpeg Description: asdfasdf Resource Type: Article Creator: Wead, Adam Garner Keyword: e File Format: jpeg (JPEG File Interchange Format)  When I do a catalog search for "snapshot" Then I do not see the work in the results list Successful Search Results:  snapshot.jpeg asdfasdf Article e jpeg file interchange Wead  Unsuccessful Search Results:  snapshot asdf  I would expect terms in title and description fields to be stemmed and tokenized, so that partial searches would retrieve results like those above. Moreover, if you're looking for The Cat in the Hat, then searching for cats should retrieve it, or searching for cat might also retrieve caterpillar or catastrophe.
ping @olendorf I'm not sure what the expectations are from users. It may be this way for a reason, and @cam156 would know, so I'm bring it up here for discussion.
@awead this has been a known property of the system.  If the title contains spaces then the partial terms get picked up.  If the title contains the file name you need the entire word.  I do not believe Solr builds in a filename stemmer, they are expecting fields to be words separated by spaces.  It is certainly something we can address later.
@cam156 I find the filename issue very odd. Whoever remembers the file extension since typically most systems hide that from the user, but if this is the way it is... Although, you can change the filename in the file set edit page. Also, not stemming words seems a bit counter-intuitive since this is what Google does and many users seem to expect that sort of behavior.
@awead I'm not saying this can not be fixed, but we have had this issue since ScholarSphere 1.0 so it is not new and in my mind not required for the current release.
