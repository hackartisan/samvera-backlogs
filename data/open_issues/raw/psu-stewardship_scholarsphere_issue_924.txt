Hydra::Controller::DownloadBehavior#render_404 needs template at public/404
hydra-core renders a 404 error page using the template public/404.html.erb. We've removed this because we have custom error logic that renders app/views/error.html.erb. We could simply create a public/404.html.erb template file, or override hydra-core's to use our custom one.
@awead I would suggest just creating the view.  That seems like the most straight forward for future upgrades.  We could just render the error page partial in the 404 view.
