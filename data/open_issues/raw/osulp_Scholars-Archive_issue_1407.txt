Look into additional stemming in Solr, especially for names
Searching for a name doesn't match alternate forms ('steve' vs. 'steven', 'tom' vs. 'thomas'). This can be partially done using fuzzy search ('steve~) but needs to be known by the searcher, and may not work in all cases. Look into additional name stemming that would expand the index.
