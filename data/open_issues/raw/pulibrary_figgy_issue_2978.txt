Problems with ScannedMap derivatives
When a ScannedMap thumbnail derivative fails, the derivative job restarts, which then generates a new JP2 derivative. This cycle repeats. To fix this, the scanned map derivative service should rescue errors and cleanup derivatives.
I'm going to proceed with using https://app.honeybadger.io/projects/53391/faults/46628117#notice-summary as an example for a failure.
