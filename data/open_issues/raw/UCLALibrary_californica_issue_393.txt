Ingest log / error reporting for librarians
As a librarian, I want to be able to view a log of metadata errors, missing files, and other problems that arose during an ingest, without sorting through software-related errors intended for the developers. ACCEPTANCE   The ingest process produces a log of errors actionable by librarians  The log initially reports 1 type of concrete error we've seen in existing collections (either date error #239 or malformed tiffs)
I don't think we're ready to work on this ticket until we do some more requirements gathering. Here are a few of the questions that @andrewbenedictwallace and I found ourselves asking:  1. Are librarians willing to log into a web-based error reporting system like Rollbar or Honeybadger to see errors?  2. If they aren't, how will they see errors? If the errors are going to a log file, does that imply that someone is regularly fetching those errors and posting them somewhere? How would we retrieve the errors from production, where only a few people have console access? 3. Right now we use Rollbar for error reporting, which doesn't allow searching of errors. Would we be willing to upgrade our Rollbar account to allow for search, so we could easily co-locate all of the metadata errors? Or, if not, are we willing to switch to Honeybadger to get the search feature? 4. Is UCLA already developing a log aggregation service that might solve this problem? There are rumors of a UCLA library ELK stack... if that's going to be where our logs are searchable, wouldn't it make sense to wait until that solution is in place and then use it?
