Make ./bin/setup run neccesary sufia/hydra setup
See #507 rake curation_concerns:workflow:load and rake sufia:default_admin_set:create, not sure if they're idempotent, not sure if ./bin/setup is usually idempotent. I made the ticket @hackmastera
`rake sufia:default_admin_set:create`  is idempotent in current implementation at least. https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia/blob/master/app/services/sufia/admin_set_create_service.rb#L5  `rake curation_concerns:workflow:load` appears to also be idempotent; goes through like 3 or 4 classes to do what it does, but appears to use AR find_or_create_by relevant attributes for each record. 
See #507.   Doing this reliably is a pain, because you need fedora/solr to be running. If you are in dev, you might want the script to automatically start with solr_wrapper/fc_repo_wrapper, if they aren't already running. But if you are in production -- and you might want to setup a new machine in production like this -- then you can't use the wrappers.   Hmm, I might just make a `dev:setup` rake task that tries to all of this, that you only run in dev. In production you're still on your own -- but our capistrano task handles these things anyway in production, so you're good.   I might also leave this for later, not urgent right now.   Ways to check in code if solr and fedora are running:  https://github.com/projecthydra-labs/hyku/blob/9352612004d05d59cfe5a4ae9385dfc166aa4542/app/models/solr_endpoint.rb#L12  https://github.com/projecthydra-labs/hyku/blob/9352612004d05d59cfe5a4ae9385dfc166aa4542/app/models/fcrepo_endpoint.rb#L12
