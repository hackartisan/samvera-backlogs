Ask users how item was useful to them
When someone views an item from ScholarSphere, the platform should solicit their feedback on how that item was useful to them and who they are/where they are from. This information is very powerful for outreach, to get people to deposit. For example, DASH includes the following on the cover sheet of each deposit: "The Harvard community has made this article openly available. Please share how this access benefits you. Your story matters" The "Please share" link includes an identifier for the deposit and takes the user to a webform. Webform responses are thus tied to the deposit accessed. The webform fields are just about right, IMO. Harvard uses this data on the DASH Your Story Matters page and in its biannual Office of Scholarly Communications newsletter. I suspect it also uses the data other places.
