Generate CSV of changed items
Generate a CSV file of items that have changed or were modified in a given time period. The field list is defined in Support Harvesting Content to SHARE - Project 24   Query SOLR for date range  Generate CSV file and write to the file system   Note the column names should be the same as the SHARE name  The file name should be curate-to-share-from-yyyymmdd-to-yyyymmdd.csv    Create an asynchronous job that:   Run with a :from_date, :to_date, and :recipient_emails parameters  Generates a CSV  Sends the CSV as an attachment to the provided email address    Assumption: The first request won't be via a web request; Instead we will perform the request by hand (as it could be a rather lengthy query).
Is a background job needed? The make-csv-from-solr is pretty close to the level needed. And since this would be used in production only a few times, it is okay for it to require, say, me to make the file for Reid.  
I started the branch https://github.com/ndlib/curate_nd/tree/share-push-gateway and have added a few command line utilities to generate a CSV file for SHARE.
