Search Results index metadata 'box' is too narrow, Abstract wraps way too soon
With Hyrax 2.1.0, in the Search Results, the area displaying an item's metadata is too narrow, and forces Abstract to wrap way too soon. The 'metadata' div is under a 'col-md-6' div, which may be the culprit. Can see on our staging results, or on Nurax, about halfway down this page: https://nurax.curationexperts.com/catalog?locale=en&page=16&q=&search_field=all_fields May want to submit this fix to Hyrax too.
This was part of the change to include User Collections in search results, and if one is present, there's a new column with info boxes for Collections and Works (see screenshot). https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/blob/master/app/views/catalog/_index_list_default.html.erb  ![screenshot from 2018-07-06 17-40-59](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2293544/42405006-76c84af8-8144-11e8-9949-20bd2fdf9a81.png)  There's a conditional to check if the Collections are present already, could extend that to the 'col-md-6' div, changing that to 'col-md-10' or something if it's not present.
