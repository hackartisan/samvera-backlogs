Switch dev environments over to MariaDB
Our current dev environment supports MySQL for local development work, but the production environment uses MariaDB. We should switch everyone over to MariaDB to keep everything in sync. Once this is done, we can remove this: https://github.com/psu-stewardship/scholarsphere/blob/develop/db/migrate/20161010203400_create_qa_local_authority_entries.rb#L16-L19 Installing MariaDB is easy. On Mac, you can use brew, but need to remove mysql first: brew uninstall mysql brew install mariadb  There's a script I use to prepare the database using a simple password: https://github.com/awead/dotfiles/tree/master/mariadb Lastly, you'll need to recompile the mysql2 gem: cd scholarsphere gem uninstall mysql2 bundle install
