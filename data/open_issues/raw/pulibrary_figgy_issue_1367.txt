Staff users can't delete FileSets they have created
The Ability class is checking whether the FileSet's depositor matches the user's id, but the FileSet's depositor property is nil.
What should it check? `depositor` on the FileSet's parent?
Checking the parent's `depositor` sounds good â€” it means there is only one definition of who deposited an item for purposes of checking who can delete things.
