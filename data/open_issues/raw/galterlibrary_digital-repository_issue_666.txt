Arey/Medical School 1859-1979 Collection Issues
@kglibrarian and Liping reports:  Liping noticed that certain items in the “Northwestern University Medical School 18859-1979” collection were not discoverable in the catalog (for example Chapter XI: Trials and Troubles does not appear when searched in the catalog). I wonder if this is because those items belong to a “multi-page collection”. Do you know if one of the implications of having a multi-page collection is that the individual items are not discoverable in the catalog? Also, I tried to “launch” the iiif viewer to look at the files and it never loaded the files appropriately (using Mozilla, if that helps)! However, I did try to launch the viewer for other files in DigitalHub and it worked fine.  Issue is specific to this collection, and items that are 'multi-page' are not affected, and can be searched/discovered in the catalog. I suspect the issue was always there, we just never inspected the collection after galterlibrary/galter-website#784 and galterlibrary/galter-website#1488 were done.
