Notify me when my import is done
STORY I would like a Hyrax notification (in browser & e-mail) when my import is complete, so that I don't have to repeatedly poll the system to see if the work is done. ACCEPTANCE   When the import is complete I get a notification in my "Notifications" list  When my e-mail is configured, I also get the same notification via e-mail  The notification indicates -[ ] How many items were created   How many items failed    When I receive the notification, the work is complete and ready for viewing   All background jobs have completed  All derivatives are available
