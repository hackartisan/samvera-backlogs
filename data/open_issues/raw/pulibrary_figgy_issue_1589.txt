Ingest "Jefferson Letters" (pudl0040)
These don't seem to be ingested anywhere. Migrate? ping @jpstroop @joycebcat
I don't see any metadata for these at all â€” no METS, the directories are named like "09April1792", so no bib/PULFA ids there, etc.
This project got stalled because RBSC wanted some special work done, which only they were qualified to do, and that never happened (my e-mails about it all date from 2008!) so it never got out of PUDL test.  The docs are a thematic grouping pulled from a number of different archival collections meaning that any MD for them is in different finding aids.
