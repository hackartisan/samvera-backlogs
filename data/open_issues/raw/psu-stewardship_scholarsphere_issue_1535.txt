Update Curation Concerns or Hyrax for JQuery Vulnerabilities
Unable to update the jQuery because we are on the latest Curation Concerns (1.7.8) that does NOT require a migration with reverse membership. Upgrading to CC 2.0 would require the relationship change and a migration to update jQuery. This is not ideal at this point in time. refs #1462
We may want to just create a new release of curation concerns 1.7.9 or fork curation concerns and change the gemspec.  These issues are related to Cross Site Scripting via the tool tip and the dialog box.
Sufia contains the same `~> 5.0` restriction on JQuery UI, so we would need to do a release of Sufia as well. Also, both Curation Concerns and Sufia have specific includes in their javascript asset pipeline files which will need to be either removed or edited to point to the correct path.
To summarize, the fix for this will be to: * update Curation Concerns to use JQuery UI 6 * publish tagged release or branch of CC (with or without passing tests) * update Sufia to use new branch/release of CC * update Sufia to use JQuery UI 6 (it won't build with a CC on JQuery UI 5) * publish tagged release or branch of Sufia (with or--more likely--without passing tests) * update Scholarsphere to use branch/release of Sufia
At this point, I don't see a way to solve this. The complexity of the dependencies between CC and Sufia are too complicated to overcome. The main problem is that even when we specify a path to a specific commit or tag, i.e. `gem 'sufia', path: 'gems/sufia'`, bundler pulls in additional dependencies and breaks certain parts of the application. Furthermore, it appears that the JS code in CC, and possibly in Sufia as well, is incompatible with the new JQuery-UI version. At the very least, we will need  additional investigation as to why the JS is giving us errors. This is on top of the existing problem that certain parts of the application just don't work anymore when we specify the reference or commit to a gem.
