The library has a separate repository for traditional theses and scholarly works, and they use Sobek, an open source platform, for other formats such as images and 3D content. Here are some examples of what they’re doing: Farid Karam M.D. Lebanon Antiquities Collection (3D scanned objects): http://digital.lib.usf.edu/karam/all Pagan shrine model (takes a few minutes to load in the interface, click on Description to see the descriptive metadata): http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0061209/00001 Digital Heritage & Humanities projects: http://usfaist.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=2652f82e6db44f1fba1b7536e0181bff ·         This site has clunky navigation, but you get the idea. Their Chalcatzingo project has a 3D model that behaves much like Kirsten would like her models to behave, with clickable labels on the object: http://usfaist.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=1fb0c305ec2b437f9254e2d1ff7339fe And here’s the 3D plugin that’s used in Sobek: https://github.com/rbernardy/SobekCM-plugin-viewer-MODEL3D Some of this stuff has a hokey video game quality to it, but I think it’s still pretty neat, and it looks really great with high-res images. I don’t think we’re necessarily looking to jump into the realm of 3D just yet, but these are just some examples of what’s out there, and things to keep in mind as we explore potential replacements for DigitalHub. Also we have lots of medical artifacts in Special Collections, which could be great candidates for the 3D treatment later on down the road.
