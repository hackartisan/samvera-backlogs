Look at search query and indexing expansion possibilities in Solr for superscript/subscript, Greek letters
Descriptive summary Titles and (probably) abstracts with superscripts, subscripts, or Greek letters in them could maybe be expanded in the index to include different variations automatically on save, instead of including, for example, 4 different alternate titles. Or another option is expanding the terms used at query time. This is not a new problem for searching/indexing so there may be settings in Solr or a Factory or something to configure to do most of this for us. Example: https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/articles/nz806428z?locale=en Expected behavior You don't have to type the actual superscript/subscript or Greek characters to get a result match. Actual behavior Right now multiple alternative titles are usually input. See in example link above.
