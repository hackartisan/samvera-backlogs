Replace File Set List on Work Landing Page?
Instead of showing a paginated list of file sets on the work landing page, should we instead link out to a separate page that lists all the file sets to keep the page clean? This new page could then link out to the individual file set landing pages. This file set list page could also be used to mange file sets, adding, deleting, re-arranging, etc. #482 mentions giving a way to download the representative file and displays a thumbnail. Universal viewer will allow individual downloads. So users will have ways to download file from the work page. 1.x has other enhancements like bulk downloads as well.
