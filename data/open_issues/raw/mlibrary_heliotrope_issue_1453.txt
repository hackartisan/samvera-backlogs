Draft Gabii revision history document
As a reader and/or book reviewer I would like to know the revision history of the platform that contains the content I am reading, and changes that were specific to the reading experience of that content. To serve as an example for Gabii Vol. 1 and future volumes, create a google doc with a basic revision history of Gabii Vol. 1 and share it with the Gabii team for group editing.
Should check with marketing to ensure what they need for second wave of promotion. Will they need this?
2/12/18: Emailed Renee to ask what the marketing plans for Gabii on Fulcrum are.
Per Renee on 2/13: No promises were made as to what and when. When Gabii migrates, Kathryn can do an email blast (Now Available on Fulcrum!) and tweet about whatever is new. Sam can update any materials that are needed for conferences. Shaun can make any ordering info changes to the pdf doc that will go on the website. I have transferred ownership of this doc to Shaun. Point of contact should be Sam for promotional coordination.
