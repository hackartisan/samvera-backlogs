Add mapping for rights.servicesContact
As a project team member, I would like to make sure all the relevant metadata from the Bennett collection is imported into Samvera. The Bennett collection has a new metadata field in the CSV "rights.servicesContact". The purpose of this field is to allow item-level guidance to a patron viewing the item about how to seek further information about re-using the object. Acceptance Criteria   @metaclaudiah has added a new row to the metadata mapping spreadsheet with the appropriate predicate  a developer on the DAMS team has added the mapping to the importer  a developer has added rights.servicesContact to the Californica item view and edit  a developer has written a ticket for the ursus team to display the field on the item detail page
