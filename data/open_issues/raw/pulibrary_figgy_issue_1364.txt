UV gotcha:  IIIF image `service` declarations have to have an `@id` and `@type` key rather than `id` and `type`, and the `profile` has to be `http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json`. `@type` should be `ImageService2`.  You can find an example v3 manifest here: https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/nubian-message-2003-04-01/manifest?v3=true
