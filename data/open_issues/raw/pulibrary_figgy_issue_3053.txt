Shapefiles with parenthesis in their filenames don't characterize properly
This is a hypothesis that needs confirmation. An example filename: Main_Economic_Indicators_of_Industrial_Enterprises_in_Manufacture_(Part_2).zip  Might be related to #2273 Also, files names that are too long cause issues. Not sure of the cutoff. Will need to experiment.
I can replicate this in via the UI in figgy-staging. Characterization fails when using the initial filename:  ``` Main_Economic_Indicators_of_Industrial_Enterprises_in_Manufacture_(Part_2).zip ```  When the file is renamed to remove the parens, the file is properly characterized:  ``` Main_Economic_Indicators_of_Industrial_Enterprises_in_Manufacture_Part_2.zip ```
