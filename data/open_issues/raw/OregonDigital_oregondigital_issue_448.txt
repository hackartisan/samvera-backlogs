Improve Type-Ahead UI 
The ingest form should give some kind of indication when type-ahead lookups are in progress, and some indication when they have failed. It's hard to tell whether it's just being slow, or something is broken.
https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/issues/166 Might make this a problem. 
See https://github.com/curationexperts/alexandria-v2/commit/7920fb2e49289a863e0871bbed8e8896d538b5b2 for an example of a fix.
