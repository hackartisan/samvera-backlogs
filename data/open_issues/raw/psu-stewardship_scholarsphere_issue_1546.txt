Agent is only filled in with email and id if the user exists in the system

the first one was found at random (no email or id), the second one was found via id (has email and id) ![screen shot 2019-02-27 at 9 29 08 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1599081/53497495-47fdaa00-3a72-11e9-8ae5-c6cdfed2c8f9.png) 
This could be a data issue with agents already existing in the system without emails.
