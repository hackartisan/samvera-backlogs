Geographic coordinates section needs clarification
Descriptive summary The Geographic coordinates section does not act like other fields. It needs clarification and cleanup.  Additional entries for all three formats (bounding boxes, geographic points, location) can be added without filling fields. (Instead of showing the "cannot add another with empty field" note.) Once you've chosen a geographic coordinate type from the drop down menu, that choice disappears from the menu and the type is on the page permanently. Trash can under Remove and separate Remove buttons for each entry is confusing. Question: What is the preferred performance here?     Related work Delete vs trash can buttons: #1777
per comment on #1777, these should all be trashcan icons.   also, to answer the above question: the only removal behavior should be for removing an individual element. there should be no behavior for removing an entire block of elements.
