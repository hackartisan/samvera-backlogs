Press landing page should use subdomain
Extracted from #93 and Blocked by #56 Acceptance criteria   There's a page at <subdomain>.<main-press-fqdn>  We may also need to host a press completely under its own domain (e.g. leverpress.org).
Updated #56. Is that all we need to unblock this story? 
Yes, this is now unblocked.  
AC: When a user is on a press subdomain, search works only within that subdomain. 
To have a press under its own domain (not a subdomain of fulcrum.org), would the same solution apply?
We need to raise this for HEB, Lever, UMPRE though.
