Embargoes are not expiring
We are still not seeing all (any?) embargoes automatically expiring. Example here: http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/honors_college_theses/fb494b287 this was manually expired by @simholt when it had not expired automatically.
"embargo_history_ssim":["An active embargo was deactivated on 2018-06-05.  Its release date was 2018-06-05T00:00:00+00:00.  Visibility during embargo was restricted and intended visibility after embargo was authenticated"]
Clara brought this one to my attention: http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/datasets/3484zm97d   Same story as above item -- embargo expired fine in dspace but item is private in Hyrax. I set it to public manually.
@zhang4952 can you give us an update on this embargo expiration issue?
So it seems like the issue lies in the embargo expiring mechanism. Some are expiring properly and some are not expiring properly. Specifically, the ones expiring improperly are expiring to the wrong visibility. This could be an issue with the data that is stored in the embargo object maybe only on migrated items from dspace.
Inspecting objects, the issue could potentially be that the actual embargo objects associated with works didn't get created properly. A good beginning course of action would be to aggregate all the works with expired embargoes from dspace and see if their equivalent objects in SA have some sort of embargo object.

@straleyb can you drop some more status updates here? i'm curious about where we stand on this issue.
Havent heard of any issues with the embargoes not expiring anymore. Need some feedback from @vantuyls @simholt if we can close this issue.
