Multi-volume PDF download
Should it give more than just the first volume? discussed at digital studio users meeting 7/19/2018
We believe this ticket references UV functionality. @escowles suggests that the UV works as intended -- downloads the PDF for the volume you're currently viewing. We should confirm.
