Get fixity checks working and running regularly
Descriptive summary Issue #451 identified problems with the fixity check service.  We really need to get it working properly for our needs so we can verify that all files are safe. See #451 for what we know so far.  However, things may behave differently now under our current version of Hyrax. All of our file set pages currently say "Fixity Check: Fixity checks have not yet been run on this object". After running this service locally, I see "Fixity Check: [passed] 1 File with 2 total versions checked 2019-04-05 10:00:45 -0400" We need to  Get Hyrax::RepositoryFixityCheckService.fixity_check_everything to run without erroring Have any emails it generates go to "scholar@uc.edu" instead of the file's owner. Schedule the service to run regularly (monthly?)  Possibly relevant: samvera/hyrax#3000
