Nursery Research Collection Ingest
Hi Steve – I forgot to mention that we do have a developer, and I can get the  info to you in whatever way is easiest to be imported. (a feed, ???) No pressing timeline, though, the summer is fine. Thanks, Erin From: "Van Tuyl, Steven" Steve.VanTuyl@oregonstate.edu Date: Thursday, March 23, 2017 at 2:43 PM To: "Martin, Erin" Erin.Martin@oregonstate.edu Subject: Re: Nursery research deposited into SA Hi Erin, This is definitely a project we could take on. That said, we are  currently down quite a few staff and don’t have much bandwidth for large  projects of this sort. That said, we are in the process of hiring and I  hope that by Summer we would be ready to take this on. What is your  timeline? Also – over the summer, we will be cutting over to our new system,  which might make upload of this content easier, allowing you (if you  care to) to load these files. Thoughts on whether that is something you  would be able to take on? Either way is fine from my perspective, I just  know that some of our stakeholders prefer a little more independence  with respect to the upload process.

It’s nursery plant research materials from about 1960 to 2010.  At this point it’s about 545 research reports and articles. You can see the pdfs listed at the bottom of this page: http://horticulture.oregonstate.edu/content/nursery-and-greenhouse-resources-oregon-state-university. It goes on for something like 30-odd pages. We are migrating this site from Drupal 6 to 7 and the new nursery  extension specialist wants to move the site in a different direction.  I’d like to have this research material entered into SA before that – I  believe most (if not all of it) is not in SA. What would you need from me to start this process? Thank you so much!

@simholt project!
Emailed Erin to see if still interested in this project.
Erin responded but is not part of the department anymore. My email was forwarded to the correct people and we'll see if they write back.
