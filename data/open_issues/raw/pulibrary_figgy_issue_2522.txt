Rename "Order Manager" button?
Continuous confusion about when to hit order vs file manager. Maybe we need to name the buttons by verb instead of noun? "Upload Files" and "Rename/Reorder Files"?
I think this would be a great thing to gather some user input on.
@tpendragon your suggestions makes sense to me. Should Structure Manager get a new label as well, or is that typically not an issue?  I agree that we should gather user input. @escowles, Were you thinking about gathering anecdotes from users when they complain about it, or were you thinking of doing some A/B or usability testing?   (Ultimately, I think it would be great to have a single UI for file, labeling/order, and structure but that's a whole separate discussion.)
I agree that having a single UI for the file manager and order manager (and that it's out of scope for now).  Having the structure manager included in that UI too seems ambitious, but would be great if we can make it all work together.  For gathering feedback, I was mostly thinking about brainstorming some options and doing a survey of our users, similar to the ones @hackmastera did at the all-hands Figgy feedback meeting.
