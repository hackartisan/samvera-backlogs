Investigate Cleanup of UI Upload File Storage
Establish a method to periodically purge the temp space to clear out storage used when users use the form to upload files. This method can we a ruby call inside the app or a bash cron script   Confirm which directories need to be purged with Collin  Write bash script, or ruby call that purges target directories  Persist script through rebuilds via Ansible
@rotated8 Can you supply the directories that will need periodic cleanup, and should there be any restrictions, such as age of file?
@eporter23 can you supply the directories that Mark P. needs since Collin is out?
@tmiles2 unfortunately, no, I don't have those details
