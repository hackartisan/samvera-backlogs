Digital Instantiation XML Ingest
Description: As an ingester, I can create new digital instantiations (and essencetracks) by ingesting a zipped file of pbcoreInstantiationDocuments. Done when:   User submits a zipped directory with digital instantiation xml files and a spreadsheet manifest, and it kicks off a batch.  Manifest has a header row and then one row per xml file, with filename, parent asset id, generation, holding organization, and any other field in the digital instantiation model.  Digital Instantiations (and the child essenceTracks) are created as children of the parent asset id specified in the manifest  Multiple Digital Instantiations with the same parent asset can be part of the same batch  Digital Instantiations have the data mapped from the xml. If an element isn't included in the xml, it checks the manifest and used data that it finds there. If there is no data for an element in the xml or the manifest, it does not fill in that field.  Submitting, monitoring, and reviewing batches uses the same interfaces as all other batch ingest types.
@sroosa is this done? @jasoncorum 
@afred yes, but I haven't been able to finish QA on it since it was completed at the same time as us running migration and I didn't want to interrupt.
