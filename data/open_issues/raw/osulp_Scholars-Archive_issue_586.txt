Add CrossRef FundRef funders as Questioning Authority source
For the type-ahead source for the Funding Body field, QA should search CrossRef's FundRef funders list. Here is CrossRef's search widget with type-ahead: http://search.crossref.org/funding and code: https://github.com/Crossref/fundref-widget That appears to be hitting search.crossref.org Example of full list with tokenized labels: http://search.crossref.org/funders? The field should store the URI: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000003
@simholt i recall you checked on this and it looked like fundref was available for use and populated enough to be useful. is that correct?
@vantuyls Yep. It isn't perfect but getting better every day.  **LOOKINTO FUNDER REGISTRY (no more fundref)**  - https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/ - Currently (Jan 2018) have almost 16,000 funders listed. - Is updated monthly. - Search: https://search.crossref.org/funding - API: https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc - Funder Registry: https://github.com/CrossRef/open-funder-registry - CSV of registry: https://doi.crossref.org/funderNames?mode=list - More tech stuff: https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/sections/203055563-Funding-data  Review from Jan 2015 https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2015/01/28/what-has-fundref-done-for-me-lately/  Did a scattershot search using some OSU papers --  Not included:  Washington Blueberry Commission Washington State Commission for Pesticide Registration Northwest Agricultural Research Foundation  University of Tennessee, Knoxville  USDA Forest Service (USDA, yes; Forest Service, yes) Rocky Mountain Research Station's Great Basin Native Plant Project Malheur County Education Service District  Northwest Potato Research Consortium   WoS fundings listings arenâ€™t always accurate. Some have weird numbers/letters in places.
