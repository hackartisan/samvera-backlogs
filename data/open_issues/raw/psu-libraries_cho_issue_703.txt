Text extraction of redacted preservation files
Typically, text extraction is performed on the preservation file. However, if there is a redacted preservation file, we probably want to use the redacted file instead.
#135 says any file with machine-readable text should be extracted, not just the preservation file. However, if the fileset has a `_text` or  `_service` file present, they should be preferenced, in that order, over extracting from a preservation file to conserve system resources. This should probably be consistent app behavior for all transactions.  This would only apply if the `_preservation` file already has machine-readable text present. CHO should always assume if there is a `_preservation_redacted` file in the fileset, it should never extract text or generate derivatives from the `_preservation` file. There is a related caveat in #548. Should there be a separate ticket to make this behavior default behavior for all transactions?
TODO: * ensure that text extraction and any other derivative generation is using the redacted preservation file if present * note that `preservation` method should implicitly return the redacted one
