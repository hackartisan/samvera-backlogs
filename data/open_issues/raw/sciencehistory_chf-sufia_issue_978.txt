360 photos of museum objects?
Just leaving this idea here since I had it and didn't want to lose it. @MDiMeo . Not something we've decided to do, just something for possible future consideration. We could offer "360 degree photos" of certain museum objects, that let the user spin it around to see from all angles.  This is a thing that some ecommerce sites use (google "360 degree product photo"). I'm not entirely certain what it would entail on the software end; it would obviously entail more photographic labor and perhaps equipment.
Actually, this has come up a bunch of times already over the years, with various members of staff. We can talk more about it, but at present we don't have the photography equipment or staffing for this to be feasible. 
It looks to me from my research that it might not take very expensive equipment, but I could be wrong. If you have the right software, it may take not that much staff time, either.  But one way or another it would certainly be added expense (staff time and/or software, and of course we'd have to add the feature to our repo to ingest and present them), it would definitely make sense for it to be something approved as a project at a higher level than our team. But I suspect it may be more feasible than you think, if the Institute wants to do it.
