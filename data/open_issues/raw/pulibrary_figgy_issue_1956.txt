Ingest origin field on pudl0038
required by #1588 requires #2473
Origin appears to be a date field. examples: http://pudl.princeton.edu/results.php?v1=Menzies%2C+Elizabeth&f1=kw&b1=AND&v2=&f2=kw&b2=AND&v3=&f3=kw&year=before&ed=&ld=&sort=score&rpp=10&view=pudlUI http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/nz806032w 
[originInfo](https://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/userguide/origininfo.html) can be used for all kinds of stuff, but in this collection it's only used for the date created.  A simple use case: ``` <originInfo>    <dateCreated encoding="w3cdtf" keyDate="yes" qualifier="approximate">1891</dateCreated> </originInfo> ```  A date range use case: ``` ./mp028/0655.mets:   <originInfo> ./mp028/0655.mets-      <dateCreated encoding="w3cdtf" keyDate="yes" point="start" qualifier="approximate">1860</dateCreated>                                                                                                   ./mp028/0655.mets-      <dateCreated encoding="w3cdtf" point="end" qualifier="approximate">1880</dateCreated> ./mp028/0655.mets:   </originInfo> ```  Note the "approximate" qualifier in both of the above cases.  There's also unknown, which I think we could ignore; it's not even dateCreated just dateOther. ``` ./mp043/1330.mets:   <originInfo> ./mp043/1330.mets-      <dateOther>Unknown</dateOther> ./mp043/1330.mets:   </originInfo> ```
Need feedback on how to import approximate dates. and approximate date ranges.
Alexis confirmed that we need to retain this qualifier.   Anna [1:59 PM] We don't currently have a way to encode that in figgy so I'll need to implement something. We are thinking free text when it's just a single date like "approximately 2019" and an "approximate" toggle for date ranges.   Alexis A. [2:00 PM] that seems fine to me.  we often use approximate or circa for dates when we know it's say, from the 1880s, but don't know the exact year
