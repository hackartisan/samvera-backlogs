Support incremental content exporting for upload to APTrust
Descriptive summary We need a way to export content out of Scholar and saved on the file system in BagIt format suitable for upload to APTrust. We likely want 1 bag per work.  The files attached to that work would be part of the bag. The process should use a date range that will allow exporting of content that has been created or changed within that date range. A rake task is a suitable solution. We should scan the Samvera community and see what others have been doing with bags and/or APTrust.  Penn State has been doing lots with this.
