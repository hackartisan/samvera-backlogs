Add OSU Distinguished Professors to Featured Researcher area 
this requires emailing/asking the 3 professors if they would be willing to be featured.  - Sarah - do you want me to do this?

one issue at hand is that  we don't have a way to cycle through these in the system - once you set the featured researcher, you have to stick with that one until you manually set another one. We ought to discuss how to manage these outside of the system, and a schedule for setting them. @simholt @boockm
