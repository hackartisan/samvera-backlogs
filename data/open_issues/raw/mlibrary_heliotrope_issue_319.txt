Customize the "more" lightbox
When a user clicks on the More button in facets (e.g. Creator, Language), they get a lightbox with the additional results for that facet. Suggested ways to customize/improve:   Improve the usability of the box by placing the close out x in the top right so it's clear how to close out the lightbox.  Disable Previous/Next if the number of results proves these controls useless  Disable A-Z or Numerical Sort if there is only one item showing  For consideration: Would it be possible to have all of the results show, not just the sixth and beyond option?
