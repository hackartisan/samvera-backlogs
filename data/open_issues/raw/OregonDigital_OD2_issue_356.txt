[Wait] Add :original_filename property
Descriptive summary Add :original_filename as a property with premis:originalName as the predicate: http://www.loc.gov/premis/rdf/v3/originalName For now use the full predicate in the definition, not RDF::Vocab::PREMIS. That actually references PREMIS v1, we want v3. The rest of the info on the MAP is updated. In OD1 the predicate used was http://opaquenamespace.org/ns/full but this was never defined as a property. Expected behavior Original Filename is viewable/editable on the edit form. Don't include on show page. Don't have searchable from main search box. Related work #347
Re-evaluating this and other metadata on FileSet pulled out of file characterization.
Waiting to QA until we either have some seed data in or someone makes a new test item on OD2 staging.
