Invalid user
There is a username "https:" in the system that looks suspicious. This might be a bug (or a hacking attempt?). We should get rid of this user and prevent its creation in the future. According to the stats page, the user was created on 5/6/2015 Also, the user page does not return an error (e.g. user not found) when an invalid user is used. For example, you can go to https://scholarsphere.psu.edu/users/whatever and not realize that this not a valid user.
