Invalid link to download 1000-pixel JPEGs of very wide images
Some very wide images (e.g., scrolls like https://figgy.princeton.edu/catalog/7f761a3b-5d00-4e24-9bee-3c865f51285d) are generating 1000-pixel download images that include figgy_prod/figgy_prod/ when there should only be one figgy_prod.  The duplication does not appear in the manifest, so this may be in the UV code that builds the link.
