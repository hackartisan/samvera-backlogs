FAST api call needs error handling and timeout
Currently when it fails it blocks other javascript from executing and the save button is thereby disabled.
here's what I get querying the api via questioning_authority directly in browser: https://gist.github.com/hackmastera/bde80ea390cde953aba60b361b2956d0  on the javascript side it looks like a 404.
jrochkind [1:46 PM]  doh i'm having trouble saving a record in my dev at all, wonder if it's related.  [1:47]  I think it may be related. it's timing out waiting for the FAST API maybe. anna [1:48 PM]  yeah it looks like there's a javascript error that's disabling the save button as a side effect.  jrochkind [1:48 PM]  dev copy gets stuck in the log at `Started GET "/authorities/search/assign_fast/all?q=artist`.  [1:49]  If I control-c out of the server, I get, among other things, a `Completed 401 Unauthorized in 82364ms (ActiveRecord: 0.0ms)`.  [1:49]  Is that FAST integration project done yet? New requirement: Fail gracefully when the FAST service is down, with a timeout.   i think the difference is in the user interface when the FAST API isn't working, we just don't use it at all.  
FAST service down again on 4/25/17
We seem to be having more FAST errors, there was a 500 error in the javascript. Patrick and I also got a 404 for "GET https://digital.chemheritage.org/authorities/search/local/subjects?q=ga" when we tried to do it again.
