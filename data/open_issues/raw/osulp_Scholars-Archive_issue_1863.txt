Build a list of works that need to be updated  
Descriptive summary It would be nice to have a list of all the works that need to be updated. These updates are associated with #1861 and #1862 which are the processes proposed for the fix. The metadata fields that need to be removed are "Title" and "Abstract" These exist still in the metadata and can be accessed using the console. work.resource.dump(:ntriples) for a specific work will show the metadata and <Subject> <DC::Title> <String> is the triple. We are specifically looking for the subject that doesnt have #nested_ordered_title and #nested_ordered_abstract appended to the end. Conference Section also needs its predicate updated. The predicate that would show in the triple is https://w3id.org/scholarlydata/ontology/conference-ontology.owl#Track which needs to be changed to https://w2id.org/scholarlydata/ontology/conference-ontology.owl#Track. If we could get a list of all the works that fall under these and any other updates needed, then we could quickly and easily process these changes.
