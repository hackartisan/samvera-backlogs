Takedown Policy Page
As an archivist, I would like to communicate to CHO users that we are not always able to identify copyright, privacy, publicity, or trademark issues in archival collections when digitizing and provide a clear pathway for users to contact us about issues in our collections, So that I can adhere to professional best practices and ethics.
