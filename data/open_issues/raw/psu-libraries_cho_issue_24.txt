Audio/Visual transcripts
As a user, I would like to be able to view a transcript of an audio or video object in real time as the audio or video is playing on the screen, so that I can better navigate the content.
Perhaps we can try automated transcriptions with Microsoft's Cognitive Toolkit? https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/10/microsoft-releases-open-source-toolkit-used-to-build-human-level-speech-recognition/  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/
