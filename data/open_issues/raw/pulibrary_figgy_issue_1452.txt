Bulk ingest not pulling data from PULFA
Currently does not pull data from finding aids site.
Looking at the code, I don't see why this wouldn't work with a PULFA component ID â€” should this be "Save & Ingest doesn't work with archival materials", or is there some part that errors?  *update:* `rake bulk:ingest BIB=AC044_c0003 DIR=tmp/files` successfully pulled metadata from PULFA, so I think this works on the command line, but not with Save & Ingest.
This was a report about the bulk ingest page (https://figgy-staging.princeton.edu/bulk_ingest/scanned_resource). Save & Ingest works with PULFA IDs.
I should note I haven't tried to replicate; just created the ticket based on slack discussion.
Sorry, I was confusing that with the `bulk:ingest` rake task.
