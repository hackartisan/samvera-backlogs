Broken player showing in empty lecture
Originally reported by: Edward Henry (Bitbucket: ethenry, GitHub: ethenry)  If a lecture work is created but no audio or video file is uploaded, a broken player is displayed on the item show page. This was fixed for courses, and the fix simply needs to be propogated..   Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/ethenry/ucsc-sufia-based-dams/issue/24
