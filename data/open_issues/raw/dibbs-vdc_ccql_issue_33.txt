Funder
I agree with Robert that it would be great if "Funder" could be a drop down with a list of major funders.
Currently, the Funder is an auto-complete field, with a very limited controlled vocabulary. The potential options are defined in a [YAML file](https://github.com/dibbs-vdc/ccql/blob/243f43cdc64425ea9729a89208f19e409107f9b9/config/authorities/vdc_funding_sources.yml).  If you were to try typing "Math" or "Janice" it would give you a list of options. If there's nothing close to what you want to put as funder, it'll allow you to enter that instead.  I believe we are eventually going to modify the controlled vocabulary to pull from https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/, but when I last checked, that list is over 10k long, and I think there was some talk of limiting it.  So, Question -- What should the controlled vocabulary look like for the funder?  Also, across the board, the descriptions/hints for the fields are lacking. It probably would have been helpful to have something prompting the user to start typing or at least indicating that it was an auto-complete field to begin with.  I think I'll open up a separate issue for that.
