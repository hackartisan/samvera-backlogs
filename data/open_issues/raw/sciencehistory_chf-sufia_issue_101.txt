Data Validation: Extent
Integers and decimals are allowed (no fractions). If possible, for decimal values less than 1, the decimal marker is preceded with a zero. @hackmastera, Do you think it also makes sense to do character/word checks here? Like say for cm, Diam, pages, etc.
I would vote to leave this as a free-text field without validation, for the following reasons: 1. It won't be faceted, so the data in aggregate doesn't matter. 2. It won't be used to link to other systems 3. If users have a legitimate use case that we haven't thought of, it will frustrate them.
