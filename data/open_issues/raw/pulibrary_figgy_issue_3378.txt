BrowseEverything is ingesting non-existent BMP files from Google Drive
This behavior was reported by a user: I have some files that I am uploading from google drive that are originally tiffs but are ingesting as bmps. Anyone have any idea why that might be happening?  this record https://figgy.princeton.edu/catalog/c4865c2f-01d5-42c3-ab2e-2ee61ea35199  The BMPs appear to have been uploaded with TIFFs:  The user confirms that these BMP files do not exist in the Google Drive Folder.
I'm now not certain that this is related to `browse-everything`, as I could not reproduce this using Google Drive Folders containing image files in the TIFF.
