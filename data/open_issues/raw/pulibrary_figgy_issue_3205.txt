Auth token for dpul
An auth token can be made which only allows display and access of manifests for items which are complete and not private. Current hypothesis: groups reading_room and authenticated. It’s going to have to get around the reading room IP restriction. If getting around the reading room IP restriction is too annoying, maybe make that a separate ticket; these materials aren't expected to go into dpul anyway and finding aids won't need this functionality. Maybe separate out the reading room sync access. refer to https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AKB1CRRc5g1BV1qstKvAA90xg042fizfyYZHGsMkVes/edit
I'm currently thinking that if we don't have a use case for putting reading room only stuff in dpul then let's not even make it a separate ticket.
We don't need to include Reading Room Only content in DPUL at this time, so we're not sure we need this now.
This is to allow Campus IP materials to be indexed in DPUL — maybe as easy as generating a token for DPUL and using it.  Or just include the auth token in emitted messages.
