Data validation: External ID
Object ID: ####.###.###., where # is an integer 0-9 OR  ####.### AND allow letter prefixes A, B, FA, GB, IG, P  Bib No.: B#######x, where # is an integer 0-9, but the last digit can be either an integer or an 'x' Item No: I#######x, where # is an integer 0-9, but the last digit can be either an integer or an 'x' Accession No.: (for Archives) ####.### OR ####.###.###  With the issue of legacy accession numbers being ##:##, Patrick told Sarah to change them into the above format going forward in Hydra, so would it be possible to always insert '19' to the first part, and '0' to the second part if they are two digits? And change the colon to a period? If not, it should be fine too, as Sarah is putting that into the digitization procedures. (for Museums) - allow letter prefixes A, B, FA, GB, IG, P OR ##:##  ASpace Ref. No.: They look like this: aspace_0396a206bcecfe8a2a70b7f59e7af082 so maybe always 'aspace_[mix of 32 numbers and lowercase letters]' Oral History Interview Number: ####, where # is an integer 0-9
For the museum letter prefixes, Stephanie mentioned:  [‎11/‎3/‎2015 12:47 PM] Lampkin, Stephanie:  I will need to maintain the appearance of the old accession numbers.  Could I have the functionality to add a space when needed?  For example they vary between FA 2012.14 or IG98:15 
It's also so messy with the Object IDs and Accession Numbers that I wonder if we just allow curator's choice of numbers and letters, split by periods and colons.
