Add OCR text extraction job for documents, add fulltext to index, keywords in context in results
Add job to extract OCR text from PDFs, also Office documents (?)  https://github.com/samvera/hydra-derivatives/blob/master/lib/hydra/derivatives/processors/full_text.rb For OD we put this in an external datastream, 'content_ocr'    Add text to search index  Add keyword in context in search results to show hits: https://oregondigital.org/sets/osu-historical-publications?utf8=%E2%9C%93&set=osu-historical-publications&q=&search_field=all_fields&set=osu-historical-publications&q=agriculture  Allow a way to view full text on an item page? (maybe just by admins)  Some of the OD code is here: https://github.com/OregonDigital/oregondigital/tree/master/lib/pdf_ocr https://github.com/OregonDigital/oregondigital/blob/master/app/models/document.rb
