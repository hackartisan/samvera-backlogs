Data dictionary fields that are "required"
Currently, any DD field that whose requirement designation is "required" has a defined property such that required: true. Because data dictionary fields are applied to all resources (collection, work, file set and file), this effectively means any field that is "required" is required for all of these resources. We need a mechanism to require a field that can use change set validations and is independent of class. This could be a custom validation method that looks up the work type or Schema::MetadataField of the field in question and makes the requirement determination from that. Furthermore, it may be that we don't need to use the required: true|false syntax at all and solely rely on this custom strategy. Blocked by #672
