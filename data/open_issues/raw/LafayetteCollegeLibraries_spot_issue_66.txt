add metadata to iiif manifests
we'll need to update this initializer config line, since it currently only uses the title (if that): https://github.com/LafayetteCollegeLibraries/spot/blob/master/config/initializers/hyrax.rb#L154
looks like we can override this in each presenter:  https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/hy-c/blob/13a13b2c185c3bd4c8e499596ec8cdbefa2d55c0/app/presenters/hyrax/work_show_presenter.rb#L194-L207
