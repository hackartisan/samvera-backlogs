Investigate ability to search by ID in Curate
Can we configure the Curate search to search by an item's NOID ID?
How is the ID stored in Solr? Can the ID field be added to Blacklight's search terms? (https://github.com/emory-libraries/dlp-curate/blob/master/app/controllers/catalog_controller.rb#L117)
