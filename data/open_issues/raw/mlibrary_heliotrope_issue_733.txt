Sort by preference not remembered?
Should the user's preference for "sort by" on the Monograph catalog page be remembered? Currently this preference is forgotten once the user navigates away to an asset and returns.
This appears to be the default behavior of blacklight.  Probably best to wait until after the update to Hyrax and then revisit this card.  Blocked by Hyrax
