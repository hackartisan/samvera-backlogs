Relax resource type validation
ISSUE The validation for Resource Type requires me to exactly match capitalization.  This doesn't provide any specific user value and is likely to trigger unnecessary support calls.  I.E. failing to match the exact capitalization of "Map or Cartographic Material" isn't a meaningful discrepancy and we should also accept "map or cartographic material" or "Map Or Cartographic Material" as valid matches. In addition, the User Interface allows clients to select multiple resource types, so we should be consistent and support this in the CSV importer as well. ACCEPTANCE   resource type validations are not case sensitive  resource type values allow multiple values separated by the default separator (currently |~|)  duplicate resource type values are ignored - i.e. Image|~|Poster|~|Image sets the resource type as Image and Poster  So, for example, I would expect everything in the following test except for row 3 to be valid - especially row 5 & 6. The CSV file has the following errors: Invalid Resource Type in row 1: iMaGe Invalid Resource Type in row 3: 123456 Invalid Resource Type in row 4: othER Invalid Resource Type in row 5: part of book|~|journal|~|article Invalid Resource Type in row 6: map or cartographic material  I should also be able to import multiple resource types to match the behavior in the User Interface.  The application currently flags multiple values as errors: The CSV file has the following errors: Invalid Resource Type in row 2: Poster|~|Image Invalid Resource Type in row 3: 123456 Invalid Resource Type in row 5: Part of Book|~|Journal|~|Article Invalid Resource Type in row 6: Map Or Cartographic Material
