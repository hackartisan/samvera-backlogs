Descriptive summary It's time to do a bundle update and get us current on gems. Also update from rails 5.1.6.1 to 5.1.7 (may require updating https://github.com/uclibs/orcid/tree/rails-5-1-6 as well) Also update the ruby version to 2.5.5 (requires updating .ruby-version and .travis.yml)  This will require a ruby upgrade on the web servers during deploy
