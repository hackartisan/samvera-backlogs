Support for the Downloading of Large Data Files
DevOps element. We will need to access the PSU only directory. Need the path and protect the path. We have /public so perhaps a /psu. Need to know the limitations of Rails and where files live. Needs some experimentation for the best process. Works or Collections above 5GB perhaps? Config bit. Consider a smaller threshold? Manually at first and test how long it takes to process. One at a time.
DSRD team will write a script that runs nightly and finds files that are  - over a certain size (it’s not clear to me this size has been determined) - either PSU accessible or Publicly accessible  The script will  - create zip files - move the newly created zip files into the proper directory (publicly accessible or PSU only) - update the object display page logic in ScholarSphere to display a direct link to these zip files that have been created.  It’s not clear to me if we are going to also write a script that periodically checks if the permissions of these files have changed, and if they have then we need to remove the zip files. I believe the initial script that moves files into psu or public directory will also move zip files out.  
TO DO for 4.0 release:  - If the access level changes from public, the the work will still be accessible until the rake task runs - Make the rake task a scheduled task (cron job) - turn rake task into a job  Making notes to capture the conversation from the 3.9 retro
