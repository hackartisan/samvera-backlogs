Most recent NU brand guidelines include changes in the color palette
The most recent document describing NU brand guidelines has a slightly different standard color palette that the one we've been using. See the full doc here. Page 68 shows the new colors and hex codes. We should update accordingly when we can.
UPDATE: The NU brand guidelines linked above and the [Northwestern Medicine brand guidelines](https://northwestern.app.box.com/v/NM-brand-guidelines) are different.  Let's hold off for now and forget I mentioned this :)
