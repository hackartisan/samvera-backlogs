Try to handle circa dates better in Decade processing function
Some(all?) circa dates aren't handled by the Decade processor. Try stripping out: ca. circa \d\d\d\d circa  (OHBA has these) before sending the date through.
We've been trying to use the earliestDate and latestDate predicates for circa dates instead. When we catch them, that is. 
Good point. I don't think most OSU collections have them (yet). It would be nice to have the Decade code pull from those too if they exist.
