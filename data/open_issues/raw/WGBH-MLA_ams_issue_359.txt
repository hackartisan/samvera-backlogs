Add md5 to Digital Instantiation model and ingest
User Story As a user, I need to be able to add an md5 to a digital instantiations, so that I can keep track of that, rather than just putting that in local instantiation identifier and not be able to tell the md5 apart from other instantiation identifiers Additional Information md5 should be free text, not repeatable, and not required. Done Looks Like   md5 is in Digital Instantiation model and edit form  md5 appears on Digital Instantiation show page, if there is a value for the field in the record  md5 is added to the Digital Instantiation PBCore Zipped Ingest manifest file
