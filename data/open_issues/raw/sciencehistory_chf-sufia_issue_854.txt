Selected facet disappearing after further limit is applied
Not sure if bug, but some weird behavior: Selecting facets: step 1) language > french, 2) subject> science on postage stamps, 3) format > text. After i click the last facet "text", the subject facet disappears. That doesn't happen with any other selected facet, even though the subject still exists on the record. daniel [5:15 PM] To be clear, the selected subject (Science on postage stamps) vanishes not the entire subject fact box. jrochkind [5:15 PM] thanks for verifying it’s happening on production too! Is the subject that exists no longer in the top 5 (by number of items), which is all that gets shown there? it should still show up as a constraint though. i’ll have to look i guess. prob not super high priority. but might just be a bug or ‘feature’ of the stack. clu [5:16 PM] maybe, it's the 6th in alphabetical order that might be it! jrochkind [5:17 PM] oh, do we have subjects alphabetical instead of by count? But it’s prob something like that. would take some painful debugging to figure out exactly what it is. and then we probably can’t fix it anyway, heh. but good to capture it in an issue, why not. clu [5:17 PM] they all have the same count (1) i assume at that point it's alpha order jrochkind [5:17 PM] ah yeah might be.
