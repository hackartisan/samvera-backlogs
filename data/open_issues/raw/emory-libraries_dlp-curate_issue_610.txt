Security assessment - remediation work: Implement the solution identified in issue 609
Description of the risk identified by the security team: https://emory.app.box.com/file/528500401683 (R-08) Configuration Management: RDS - Encryption of Data in Transit: Communications to/from the database may not be appropriately encrypted. For ePHI workloads this violates the terms of the Amazon Business Associate Agreement. For all workloads containing sensitive information, lack of network encryption to/from the database can lead to the potential exposure or compromise of sensitive data while in transit over the network. Security Recommendation: Connections to RDS MySQL databases must use transport encryption. For more information on enabling encrypted connections, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html
