Semi-controlled properties
The system of record id field is semi-controlled. It consists of a controlled prefix, and an uncontrolled id. The stored value for the property should be the concatenation of the prefix, a colon, and the uncontrolled id.   Research if Select2 support these requirements  If it can, implement them using Select2  If it cannot, validate using regex and the prefixes from the attached epic.  The form field should show an example.  Create/Update a feature test for this.
6/10: discussed pushing this to 0.5. The goal is to enforce some type of standard prefix convention for legacy/other system IDs, but this doesn't have to be done in 0.3.
Relate this to epic #203 Metadata Form Enhancements (can't assign through UI for some reason)
