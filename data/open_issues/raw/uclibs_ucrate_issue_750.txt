Implement a REST API interface that allows work creation
Descriptive summary Refs: #707 We need a (versioned) API for integration with Research Directory and other services.  The API should allow us to send JSON to Scholar to create and update works. The API should allow remote services to use an API key to create content (instead of passing user authentication) Resources:  Original issue on scholar_uc_legacy: uclibs/scholar_uc_legacy#19 API Documentation : https://systest.ahctest.uc.edu/eprof/cfc/fetcheprofdatadoc.cfc?method=getdocumentation Example of API return on a 6+2 query: https://git.uc.edu/UCLIBS/api-documentation/blob/master/research_directory/get_wb_page_data-sample-formatted.xml  Sample JSON responses for Scholar searches, collections, works, and files:  https://scholar.uc.edu/catalog.json https://scholar.uc.edu/collections/h128nf812.json https://scholar.uc.edu/concern/images/kw52j9012.json https://scholar.uc.edu/concern/parent/kw52j9012/file_sets/cn69m5141.json  Other Samvera implementations using APIs for ingest  https://wiki.dlib.indiana.edu/display/VarVideo/Avalon+Ingest+API https://github.com/aic-collections/aicdams-lakeshore/blob/master/script/ingest-api.sh  Minimal set of components for ingesting a file into Scholar  UC login (and an established user object in Rails database) Select a work type Metadata  Title Creator (multiple) College Program/Department Description License Advisor (multiple) - Student Works, ETDs Degree Program - ETDs   Select visibility Read and agree to distribution license Upload file  Tasks   Collections: create, update, read  Works: create, update, read  Users: create, update, read  File upload, attach, characterize  API keys  Validation  API versioning  Documentation  Testing file upload in bulk
