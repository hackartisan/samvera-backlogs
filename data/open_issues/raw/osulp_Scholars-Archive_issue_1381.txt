Fileset_id points to a child work
I find it happens at least with one work: https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/administrative_report_or_publications/cv43nw997, where file_set_id points to a work vq27zn63h. So when we try to get the fileset name using 'label_ssim' with id 'vq27zn63h', it will fail. The actual fileset is https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/parent/vq27zn63h/file_sets/2z10wq351 under vq27zn63h. We can fix these errors manually in Rails Console if it only happens to few works.
