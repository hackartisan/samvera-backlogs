generate cover pages for IR pdfs
There's a request to have article PDFs that are ingested have cover pages created which display citation info.
there are two points at which we can add these pages:  1. at ingest, making the pres-master the updated pdf with title page   a. lessens load time for downloads (since the page isn't been added on request)   b. removes possibility of items that don't need title pages having them added (since this would likely be a flag on the form) 2. store original pdf as pres-master, generate title page on download request   a. allows us to dynamically change the cover when necessary (update design to match college identity, add metadata, etc)   b. seems more sound, from an archival standpoint, to preserve the original and not the updated document   c. would allow us to use this pipeline for things other than IR documents (images, perhaps)  personally, I lean towards the second option as there seems to be more flexibility there.
in any event, a possible pipeline for this could be:  1. pass metadata through to a [LaTeX] template to generate the cover; save it as a pdf 2. merge the new cover pdf + the original document using `pdftk`  [LaTeX]: https://www.latex-project.org
