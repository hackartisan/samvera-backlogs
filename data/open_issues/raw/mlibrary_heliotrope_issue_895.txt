Make user menu match dashboard navigation
When logged in, the user's menu should reflect the navigation of the dashboard. For an example, look at the user menu on Elderberry: http://mlibrary.github.io/elderberry/press/book/index.html
Also, now that we're in Hyrax 2, user menu drop down does not match public view pages user menu drop down. This may need to be re-titled "Determine user menu in Hyrax 2.x"
