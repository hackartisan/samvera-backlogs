Trouble deleting files by users
Descriptive summary I have been hearing from users that when they update the files in their dataset, they cannot delete the old ones. This has happened to several people in the last few months, the most recent one on 2019-09-17 for dataset https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/datasets/g158bq449. Expected behavior  I ask a user to make changes on the dataset files. I submit comments and set up and "Request changes". User deletes the old files. User uploads new files. User selects Request Review option so that I can take a look at the new files.  Actual behavior  I ask a user to make changes on the dataset files. I submit comments and set up and "Request changes". User tries to delete some files. They can delete some of them, but the delete option does not show up for some of the files. (These are typically files that were uploaded through scholarsarchive@OSU directly by the user, in case that makes a difference. ) Sometimes user reports that the new files they tried to upload did not actually upload.  Steps to reproduce the behavior This has never happened to me, only to users. Related work
