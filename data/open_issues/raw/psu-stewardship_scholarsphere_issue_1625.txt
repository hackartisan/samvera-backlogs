Display README for Software or Program Code
It looks like README.txt/md files are only displayed on a Work page if the Work is a Dataset. They should also display for Works with type "Software or Program Code"
@awead  I think the issue is that this: https://github.com/psu-stewardship/scholarsphere/blob/71ca6b850374a98ccc5824936a1f7a86712f0dec/app/presenters/work_show_presenter.rb#L37-L39  Should refer to `'Software or Program Code'`(and `'Map or Cartographic Material'` for that matter).
