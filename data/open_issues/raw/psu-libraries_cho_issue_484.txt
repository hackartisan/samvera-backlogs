Optimize metadata display on collection and work landing pages
As a public user, I would like to see work metadata displayed in a way that gives me the most important first, So that I don't have to read through fields that are less important. Non-core fields can be in separate tab or accordian section, some sort of accessible, supressed or inconspicuous UI element. Related: #127, #483
@lmballinger @ruthtillman should the data dictionary (and work-type schemas) have a field for indicating the ordering of metadata fields on show pages? Thinking this might not be the same for all works.
Make sure display order is the same for landing and edit pages.
Specify display order in work type and collection schemas.
