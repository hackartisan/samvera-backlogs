Mechanism to make sure blazegraph is up to date with its current cache
Descriptive summary We need to either have some code we can fire off that crawls all the possible values stored in blazegraph and see whether or not the fetched terms and labels are up to date. This can be code we fire off or it could potentially be code that gets fired off on a timed schedule. What would have to happen is the database is crawled and for each object, check to see if that uri is still up to date. Or we keep a separate cache of all the possible uris and crawl the cache periodically to refetch labels.
