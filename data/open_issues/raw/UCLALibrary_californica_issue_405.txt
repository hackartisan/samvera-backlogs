Re-ingest corrupted LADNN master images
ISSUE A number of LADNN works were ingested without corresponding images because the master tiffs were corrupted.  The master image files are being recreated.  Once they're available, we would like to re-attach the correct images. ACCEPTANCE Once the master images have been rescanned (see https://jira.library.ucla.edu/browse/DLG-709)   Any LADNN works with corrupted images are re-imported  The corresponding works appear with the correct images in ursus
I have compiled a list of 56 files that need to be rescanned. I will proceed with the process of getting them rescanned.  Please note 2 of the 58 bad files do not exist in DLCS as metadata. This does not worry me very much since we sometimes digitized and ingested files but later decided that the image was so poor that we did not want to publish it. Usually we would delete these files from the masters location as well, but it is possible we did not. 
The list is available here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i8lGryerGo064d4r9FAUrqrARxbhcHkEKKXlRnLqoeY/edit?usp=sharing.   Lisa has drafted an email that I intend to send to the Head of UCLA LSC Curators on Monday, March 25, 2019. Some of the corrupt tiffs are nitrate negatives, which require special handling and insurance to be moved to the scanning location. This will not be a trivial rescanning endeavor.
