We should know how this work needs to be implemented, but this functionality is not required for launch.
@shanitajohn and @rotated8  I understood we were putting this on hold for awhile while Emory creates a local authority for these. Is that right? If so, can we move this back to the backlog?
@bess Yes, that was my understanding, but I would love confirmation from @rotated8, too. 
Yep, sounds good!
