Zotero Subscription service calls run which does not exists
https://github.com/psu-stewardship/scholarsphere/blob/develop/app/services/zotero_subscription.rb#L10
This is only used to add subscriptions to existing users.  If we had any production users besides patricia and myself this could be a blocker, but since we do not I think it is a nice to have.
