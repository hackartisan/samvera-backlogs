Consider adding captcha to contact form
We are currently getting too many spam form submissions via scholarspace.library.gwu.edu 's contact form.
I attempted to do this by simply inserting the script and the div tag as described at https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin#site/340815346  .  The problem seems to be that the captcha result is not checked; i.e. the user can simply bypass it.  This appears to have been done successfully using https://github.com/osulp/Scholars-Archive/pull/1176/files  - which utilizes the `recaptcha` gem.
