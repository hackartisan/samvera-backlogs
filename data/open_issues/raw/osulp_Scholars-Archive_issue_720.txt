Enable typeahead for academic units in form. (QA for Opaquenamespace)
need typeahead for academic units in the form
want to make this work from the ONS jsonld and use rails cache store.
Per our discussion. Uses `ServiceBasedAuthority` which hits cached JSON-LD and parses it similar to `FileBasedAuthority` to make typeahead do its thing.
@straleyb is this completed? i'm not seeing this functionality in SA@OSU right now, but maybe i'm missing something. 
@simholt any sense for how important it seems to have typeahead on academic units?
@vantuyls   Not super-important. It would be nice but the drop-downs function fine.
