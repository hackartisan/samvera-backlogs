'Order manager' doesn't work with IE 11 running on windows 10, 8.1, 7. Also with IE 10 on windows 8.
@joycebcat  reported an issue with the 'Order manager'. I tested it in BrowserStack.
``` fetch is not found globally and no fetcher passed, to fix pass a fetch for your environment like https://www.npmjs.com/package/unfetch. For example: import fetch from 'unfetch'; import { createHttpLink } from 'apollo-link-http'; const link = createHttpLink({ uri: '/graphql', fetch: fetch }); ```
The https://github.com/github/fetch polyfill has stated support for IE releases 10+
IE 10 doesn't work, IE 11 does.
