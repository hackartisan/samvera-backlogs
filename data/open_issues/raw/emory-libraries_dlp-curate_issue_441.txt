Did you attach a new file through the edit page of the work?  If so, I wasn't able to reproduce this error in curate test for: https://curate-test.library.emory.edu/concern/curate_generic_works/03035cca-f226-4a29-84f5-952aa36bb221  ![Screen Shot 2019-08-12 at 8.51.53 AM.png](https://images.zenhubusercontent.com/5c488275c10ae96cd915967b/c7b08b78-9883-45f6-a5e8-7bca44bd9eac)  
@mark-dce I experienced something similar recently - see #361, which I closed because I couldn't replicate it after a certain period of time.
@devanshu-m I tested again briefly on 8/18 in curate prod - so far no duplicates! But we may need to monitor this for a few days.
@devanshu-m I tested this again in curate prod (on my home machine). In Safari, I experienced the duplicate FileSets on this new work: https://curate.library.emory.edu/concern/curate_generic_works/cor-904dncjsz6?locale=en  I then switched to Firefox, cleared cache etc. I did _not_ experience the bug on this new work: https://curate.library.emory.edu/concern/curate_generic_works/cor-3246q573nf?locale=en  Went back to Safari, cleared cache/history, and opened a new incognito browser session - did not experience the bug on this new work: https://curate.library.emory.edu/concern/curate_generic_works/cor-409j3tx966?locale=en
@eporter23 can you put this back in either backlog/queued. I am not sure what the issue is here but I could see in the database that duplicates were inserted meaning multiple ajax requests were posted. I will look into this.
Re-opening because I still occasionally see this in Safari. But, low priority to fix for now.
