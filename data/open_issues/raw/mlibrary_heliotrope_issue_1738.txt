More log pollution prevention
Similar to 1694, we could probably eliminate things like this from the logs:  CACHE Press Load (0.0ms)  SELECT  `presses`.* FROM `presses` WHERE `presses`.`subdomain` = 'heb' ORDER BY `presses`.`id` ASC LIMIT 1  [["subdomain", "heb"], ["LIMIT", 1]]   CACHE Press Load (0.0ms)  SELECT  `presses`.* FROM `presses` WHERE `presses`.`subdomain` = 'heb' ORDER BY `presses`.`id` ASC LIMIT 1  [["subdomain", "heb"], ["LIMIT", 1]]   CACHE Press Load (0.0ms)  SELECT  `presses`.* FROM `presses` WHERE `presses`.`subdomain` = 'heb' ORDER BY `presses`.`id` ASC LIMIT 1  [["subdomain", "heb"], ["LIMIT", 1]]   CACHE Press Load (0.0ms)  SELECT  `presses`.* FROM `presses` WHERE `presses`.`subdomain` = 'heb' ORDER BY `presses`.`id` ASC LIMIT 1  [["subdomain", "heb"], ["LIMIT", 1]]   CACHE Press Load (0.0ms)  SELECT  `presses`.* FROM `presses` WHERE `presses`.`subdomain` = 'heb' ORDER BY `presses`.`id` ASC LIMIT 1  [["subdomain", "heb"], ["LIMIT", 1]]  My guess is that this happens in the PressHelper quite a bit. Using the same method as in 1694 maybe we could reduce this noise from the logs.
