IIIF Badge on Object Page 
As an online user, I want to know that an image is being delivered via IIIF, So that I know additional functionality is available to me, like drag and drop into external IIIF viewer to allow user to remix content from multiple IIIF compatible sites. See discussion: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/iiif-discuss/iiif$20badge/iiif-discuss/UdzoZHQpuD4/CR6b4TM8hsoJ
