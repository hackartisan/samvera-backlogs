Failed characterization - file not found
https://app.honeybadger.io/projects/53391/faults/38688155#notice-summary record in question is a scanned resource from the historical photo collection: https://figgy.princeton.edu/catalog/be474a92-01da-4ee6-9a78-e303a3133252 title: Computer Science, Department of -- Courses -- Student computer operator prepares a box of IBM cards for processing. Princeton at present (June 1967) has two large machines at the heart of its computing facility: an IBM 7094 and IBM Model 67.
I think this has to do with the file having a pound sign in the name of the file.
so should we ask the person to change the filename and try again? not sure what we can do on tika.
We might be able to just pass the argument better - I dunno, we'll have to look into it.
