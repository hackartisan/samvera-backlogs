Generate preservation workflow and events log
Story As a Repository Administrator, Collection Manager or Preservation Curator, I want to to see a detailed preservation workflow and events log that provides information about any human or system-initiated events that have occurred on the object, so that I know routine preservation checks have occurred on an object as expected, and so I can troubleshoot unwanted behavior on an object Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes The repository should generate a comprehensive machine and human readable log of events and workflows applied to an object and its component files. This epic outlines a metadata structure in either RDF or XML to document system activities identified by the Digital Preservation FRG. CONFIRM: feasibility of events and workflows relative to Hyrax asynchronous processing Links to Additional Information Approved Preservation Events & Workflows Preservation Workflow Metadata properties needed Preservation Events - General Metadata properties needed Preservation Log - XML-based Mockup - HOLD for ongoing Hyrax confirmations. May need to revise this significantly. List of Preservation UI Mockups Checklist For 0.4, Hyrax-loggable Accession Workflow Events are logged Work creation   Metadata extraction (object level, from Curate form, CSV, or Alma)  Policy Assignment (assignment of rights/visibility level)  Characterization   Metadata extraction (files/FITS)  Format identification (files/FITS)  Validation (files/FITS)  File Attach Job   Message digest calculation  Virus Check   Virus check (if successful: failures will be hard to capture)  For 0.4, Hyrax-loggable Ingest Workflow Events are logged TBD:   Validation (object is complete and received by Fedora)  FileSet Save   Replication (to S3)  Fixity Service   Fixity Check [if part of ingest] - can also be a standalone Event  Additional requirements:   Log is generated as part of the Ingest process, and is compatible with bulk import tools  Log is generated for an object, but also includes information about the files attached to the object  Log is encoded as a human readable view or file that can be exported as part of a preservation object for v.1+ versions of Curate  Log can be viewed, but not directly edited within the Curate UI  Log is system-managed and allows for appending, but not revising prior log entries  Standard event metadata provided: event name, name of user or process that initiated the Event, start and end date, status such as pass/fail, and repository ids for the object or files the event applied to  Event-specific metadata provided: sub-types of actions and details; software used; specific data sources  Standard workflow metadata can be associated with events in the log: workflow name, who initiated, start and end date, status such as "complete", rights and notes information  Log may indicate if an event normally run as part of a workflow sequence was skipped  Log may document events that occurred outside of a workflow context  Log can be accessed in a read-only capacity through one or more locations in Curate, including Edit Work, but may be restricted to selected users/groups  Selected information from the log may be included in summary views available to Curate users  Selected information from the log may be indexed for reporting needs (e.g. a report of objects containing files which failed a fixity check or failed validation, or a report of objects which were ingested and made visible due to a certain rights determination)  Given/When/Then  Given (some context) and (some other optional context) When (some action is carried out) Then (a set of observable consequences should occur)
Collin did you complete the breakout of this epic?
