Hide Batch Upload
Batch Upload is prone to misuse. Mainly, it's used to create many single-file works (subsequently gathered under a collection) in situations that call for one work with many files. Also, works created through Batch Upload are titled after the filename, which is a bad practice (i.e. we don't want these kinds of titles indexed by Google Scholar). While Batch Upload is useful for some situations—for example, when someone is trying to upload PDFs of many separate articles—I don't think it should be emphasized as much as it is in the UI. A link to Batch Upload is one of the first things you see in the "Add New Work" page.  remove Batch Upload link from top of New Work Page Possibly, Indicate it somewhere else (where?).
After some discussion with @mtribone, I think I can narrow the request here. Would like to:  - Remove "Batch Create" option from the "Works" dropdown, in the toolbar.  - Remove "To create a separate work for each of the files, go to Batch upload" from the Add New Work page.   It's okay for the functionality to remain, I just want to hide it while we rethink this feature for SS 4.0.
