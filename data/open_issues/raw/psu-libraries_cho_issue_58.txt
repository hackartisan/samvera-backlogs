ability to re-define collections
As a metadata specialist I would like to be able to re-define collections, so I can break them apart or combine them, in whole or in part, at any time.
@lmballinger What does this mean? Taking one collection and splitting it into two or more / merging one or more collections into a single collection?
Take a larger collection and break it into smaller collections.
