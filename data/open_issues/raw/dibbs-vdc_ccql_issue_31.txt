Dowload Counts
Shouldn't we be able to see basic analytics about works? i.e. how many time something has been downloaded?
I started to look into this ~~, and I'm not sure I see yet the analytics per work~~. However, there are user "vitals" which show the number of downloads and views.  However, in our application, it's always 0 for both.  I'm currently trying to understand more about why this is.   What I've uncovered so far: * There's a rake command ``rake hyrax:stats:user_stats`` to generate user stats that is currently failing when I attempt to run it because the db table ``user_stats`` is currently not getting populated with anything. * Within the ``user_stats`` table there is a ``file_download_stats`` field and ``work_view_stats`` field, defined in ``db/migrate/*_create_user_stats.hyrax.rb`` and ``db/migrate/*_add_works_to_user_stats.hyrax.rb``.  I see these being tested in the ``spec`` directory, but I don't see it being used anywhere in the application itself. * I probably need to enable analytics by setting up signing up for a google analytics key and configuring ``config/analytics.yml``. I haven't done this yet.  Also, there's a working group related to Hyrax Analytics: https://wiki.duraspace.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=87461330 I haven't looked closely at their meeting notes, but it looks their were slated to deliver recommendations by August. At least some development sprints are scheduled for early 2018, which might mean that there isn't code for this yet in Hyrax.  There's more documentation about capturing Analytics via google analytics here:  https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/wiki/Hyrax-Management-Guide#analytics-and-usage-statistics
