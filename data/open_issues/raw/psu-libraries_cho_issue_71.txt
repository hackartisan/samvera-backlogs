Digital Exhibits - connections to the CHO
As a collection manager, I would like the ability to create web-based digital exhibits based on content in the repository in a fluid manner, allowing for linking/connections between exhibit content and the original item(s).  For example - a yearbook (or yearbook page) is in the repository. We use a cropped version (an image of an individual person) from that page in an exhibit. How can we show links/relationships (in both directions)?
Is this covered by #59?
