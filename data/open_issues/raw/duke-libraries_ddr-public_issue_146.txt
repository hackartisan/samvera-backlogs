OpenSeadragon pinch to zoom out gesture (when using trackpad) behaves unexpectedly
@seanaery Zoom in trackpad gesture works as expected. When using the reverse gesture, pinch to zoom out the image shifts position rapidly in the OpenSeadragon frame. I'm not sure if this is something we want or are able to support, but wanted to note that it's not working.
Now, I'm unable to duplicate this. So, perhaps it was an anomaly. 
I was just looking at it too and couldn't duplicate. The pinch interaction does seem a bit sensitive, though -- just a tiny movement zooms in/out pretty far. Maybe that can be adjusted and would help prevent unintended shifts... 
Try it on the "Mlle. Beaumaine, Paris" Item in the Duke & Sons collection. It's happening on that one for me.

Not sure if this helps, but I'm getting an error in the console that might provide a clue:  "Hash image-content has already been used."

Very strange. I still can't duplicate the problem or see that console error. We'll have to take a look in person.
