Collection Page Wireframe Followup and Implementation
May or may not need to do another round of wireframes, might be possible to incorporate directly into implementation.  Only display public core fields with collection descriptive metadata (will be addressed in #102) Add "Collection Information" label to collection descriptive metadata Emphasize Collection Information less Consider accessible, collapsible area for when narrative text gets too long... mixed feedback Emphasize Acknowledgments more Consider keeping Collection Home and Browse buttons on both landing and search pages OR maybe a clear results button on browse page? Add thumbnails to resources on search results page
Display of public core metadata fields is being blocked by #102.   Also the 'readmore' idea for long descriptions had mixed feedback from stakeholders. We not going to implement the feature in MVP 7 in order to get more feedback from users in MVP 8 when the collection landing pages are fully finished.
Todo from retro on June 21: * fix responsive layout in heading between landing and browse pages * punting on point 6 since the start over button is accomplishing this functionality, but the presentation needs some later work to make it more apparent.
