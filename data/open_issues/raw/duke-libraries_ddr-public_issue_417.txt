Download button display in search results
For digital collections items that display a download button on the show page there isn't a corresponding download button for these items on their results list display.  For non-dc collections there is a download link (on components).  We may want to be more deliberate about when and where the download button appears in the interface.
Good point. This will be a bit complicated with Digital Collections since in that case_usually_ (but not always) the file a user wants to and is authorized to download is the derivative, not the actual TIF, MOV, WAV, etc. file stored in the repository.
