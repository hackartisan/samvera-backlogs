Ephemera: "Save Draft" functionality
There should be a way to save a draft which ignores required fields, and you can go back to it. When it saves, it should mark itself as a draft.
alternate proposal: "required to publish" fields. make all fields not required, add validation to the final workflow step.
More broadly, we have some divergence on what fields are required for initial record creation, and for publishing/completing.  Looking ahead to some upcoming projects, we may have more divergence on what fields to display.  Do we want to create separate models for some of these variations?
A situation arose where we wanted to load images first, and then catalog from the images.  The "[required to publish](https://github.com/pulibrary/figgy/issues/843#issuecomment-388896047)" proposal would handle this well, by allowing a draft record to be created by the imaging studio while ingesting the images, and then metadata to be added afterwards.
