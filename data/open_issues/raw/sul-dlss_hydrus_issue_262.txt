Embargo Release Issue
This is a story-level ticket to capture observed behavior in the instance when an object that has an embargoMetadata datastream is updated after it has been released from embargo. Background:  the current state of embargo management is that a cron job running on the robots machine queries solr for objects that have an embargo release date before NOW the rightsMD from the embargoMetadata datastream is then used to replace the rightsMetadata datastream for the object - effectively releasing the embargo more detail here: https://consul.stanford.edu/display/chimera/Embargo+management+--+the+embargoMetadata+datastream  Hydrus-specific Bug:  Hydrus caches its datastreams in the /data/hydrus-files mount if an object is versioned from the hydrus app after the embargo release date, the embargo metadata and pre-release rightsMD are copied back into the active object - effectively embargoeing it again the object is then picked up again for embargo-release when the cron job next runs (so the object will be, at most, in an erroneous embargo state for 24 h max). this leads to the potentially confusing situation for the user where an object appears to be under embargo after the date when it should have been available for some short period of time  Desired behavior:  In a future self-deposit app, the datastream content of record should match the current version in the repository, and we should not be overwriting post-embargo data with pre-embargo data.  cc. @hannahfrost
