Expected behavior Pages print with all of the information in an easy to read format. Other pages printed from the site print in a similar way (no styling for the work show page should break or disrupt print styles for other pages) Related work #612 Accessibility Concerns Ensure print formatting has readable text sizes for most end users (should be nothing smaller than ~12-14 point type) QA Test printed page for work show page, home page, collection page against css.
