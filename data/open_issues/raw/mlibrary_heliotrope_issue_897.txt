Review Hyrax first
DBD has an issue similar to this, https://github.com/mlibrary/umrdr/issues/639. Depending on scheduling we should try to develop a solution with them.
Looks like the update to Hyrax definitely includes at least part of what we want. This is from heliotrope with Hyrax 1.0.1.  ![user-activity-fulcurm-hyrax](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3924142/27149882-1d1cc41e-5113-11e7-8fb3-2cc8e5f28066.png)  
In hyrax2 there's still the Activity Log for *normal user* in their dashboard, but if you're an admin you won't see one. We'll need to decide what we want to show to platform_admin, press_admins and press_editor users...
