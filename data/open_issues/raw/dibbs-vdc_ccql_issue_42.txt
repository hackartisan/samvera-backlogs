Replace Calls to Fedora with Calls to Solr
Because I had very limited knowledge on how to index and lookup information from Solr, I initially made many inefficient calls to Fedora instead when developing this prototype. Now that I know a little bit more, I need to sweep through the code, find these calls to Fedora, and replace them with calls to Solr. Some changes were made with issue #37, but many Fedora calls exist.
One issue that I've come across is that, currently, not all data for a Person is being indexed with a save.  For example, a Person contains a orcid link, but that link is not being indexed within Solr.  So, I currently need to find the User object with the Person's ``identifier_system`` in order to get the orchid.  So, maybe links don't get indexed within solr? 
I removed expensive calls to Fedora.  I kept calls to Fedora where I thought they were necessary, including when when are creating and updating people and works.   I also renamed "Creator (VDC)" labels to be just "Creator" with these changes, since I was touching related files.  I do still call the DB to get the orcid, because it's not indexed in solr.  I need to research more about why this happens, but since it's not a call to Fedora, I'm going to say these changes are good enough.
I realized that this isn't really complete.  There are calls to Fedora when generating the ``:ttl`` and ``.jsonld`` dumps from the user profile pages, which should eventually be replaced with solr graphs instead.
Also, I should probably look into calls like ``ActiveFedora::SolrService.query(query, rows: 1000, fq: fq)`` vs the straight blacklight ``Blacklight.default_index.connection.select(params: { q: "*:*", fq: "has_model_ssim:\"Vdc::Person\"", fl: field_list })``.   This based on looking at coded from a GG thread: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/samvera-tech/cTXJo6BS6CU
