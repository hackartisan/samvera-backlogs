Notes: (From UPenn; limited use case. Offer them Images?) @jpstroop Can you expand on what "limited use case" means?
Who would be talk to about these at UPenn?
> Can you expand on what "limited use case" means?  We did this volume in ~2006 for a Princeton Grad student, and it's just one volume of the complete works. I wrote a note to @egmowens over the summer to see if Penn would like a copy, but I don't think I ever heard back.
