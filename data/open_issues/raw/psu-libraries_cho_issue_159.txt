Support for OAI-PMH, ResourceSync
As a collection manager, I would like my collections to be made available as OAI-PMH and RescourceSync feeds [and IIIF Change Discovery API?], So that I can share my content with aggregation services such as DPLA and Summon. Configurable by collection and object. Dependent: #99 As a metadata librarian, I want to be able to send our records to DPLA and other people who use OAI-PMH. I need to be able to export our records as Simple DC. [Ruth K-T]
