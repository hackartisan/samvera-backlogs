Ingest "Berthier" (pudl0042)
May become ScannedMaps? Ping @eliotjordan These look like maps?
No PUDL collection page.

Ingest as ScannedMaps
This is a case where the majority of the images are text with some, admittedly nice, maps interspersed. I'm not really sure what to do in these cases. Ingest as a ScannedResource and just forgo ingesting the maps into GeoBlacklight? Ingest as ScannedMaps and have many non-image records in Pulmap? Some kind of mixed approach?
A mixed approach seems like it is worth exploring.  Maybe we could ingest the whole collection as ScannedResources, and then ingest a subset as ScannedMaps?  Who would select the maps to ingest?
`pudl0042` on the isilon PUDL directory is empty now? Also: https://figgy.princeton.edu/catalog/1d244d71-2a5e-4b7a-ade5-4fee32821ce2
