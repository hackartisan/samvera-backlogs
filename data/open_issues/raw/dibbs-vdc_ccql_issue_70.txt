Create Fixity Cron Job
Now that we've moved to Hyrax 2.0.0, it shouldn't be too much work to get a cron job running to do fixity checks.  I'm creating an issue so that it doesn't get lost. https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/wiki/Hyrax-Management-Guide#fixity-checking This is something that Ron brought up. Currently, the only thing I've checked that the following command works in the rails console (though sometimes it takes two tries): Hyrax::RepositoryFixityCheckService.fixity_check_everything  A possible solution might be to create a rake task to run this. Then, run the rake task from a cron job.
