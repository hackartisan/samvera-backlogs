This was introduced in 3381092069d9912e4a30898f50ca1a862e62192f  The problem is here: https://github.com/psu-stewardship/scholarsphere/blob/master/app/forms/curation_concerns/generic_work_form.rb#L8  Depositor has to be in self.terms so we can update it, but we probably just need to remove it from secondary terms so it's not rendered here:  https://github.com/psu-stewardship/scholarsphere/blob/master/app/views/curation_concerns/base/_form_metadata.html.erb#L29
