Export Works as Bags
As a digital preservation librarian, I would like to export individual works as bags, So that I can send them to long-term preservation storage. Acceptance criteria:  works can be exported as LOC Bags works can be exported as APTrust Bags  5 TB bag-size limit, if over bags need to be split   export is triggered by GUI and transferred to pre-determined store (TBD) preservation masters and text are included in the bag service masters are included in the bag if they were pre-supplied, but not if they were CHO generated all metadata is included as RDF
Some of the acceptance criteria may be out of scope for CHO, but keeping this in to explore in future.
