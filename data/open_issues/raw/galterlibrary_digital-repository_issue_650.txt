Mirror of Quarterly Bulletin of Northwestern University Medical School in PubMed Central
Currently the Quarterly Bulletin lives in PubMed Central but we've noticed that PMC did not upload all files - they left out Appreciations, Tributes, and Advertisements (which we think is their customary practice). We'd like to mirror the PMC collection in DigitalHub and add back in the items that were removed. The OCR PDFs (of the files that were uploaded to PMC and the additional files that they removed) are available on Aardvark and an external drive. File path in Aardvark is: R:\NUCATS\Galter_Shared-Aardvark\Committees\Quarterly Bulletin
