Metadata not indexing as facetable in Solr
Descriptive summary Non-core metadata is only being indexed as <property>_tesim which relates to Solrizer.solr_name(<property>, :stored_searchable). Solrizer.solr_name(<property>, :facetable) outputs <property>_sim and these values aren't found in the schema or documents once a work is saved. This seems to be causing facets to not appear for most metadata fields on the search page, though may not be the only factor Expected behavior Metadata that specifies to be indexed as :stored_searchable and :facetable should be indexed into Solr as <property>_tesim and <property>_sim Related work Blocks work on #271
QA: - [ ] Create new work with metadata that should and should not be faceted - [ ] ~Check Solr document that fields align with reality~   - [ ] ~Facted fields are indexed as `*_sim`~   - [ ] ~Searchable fields are indexed as `*_tesim`. Faceted and searchable may be indexed as both~   - [ ] ~Non-faceted fields are not indexed as `*_sim`~ - [ ] Check facetable fields are faceted - [ ] Check stored_searchable fields are searchable  Edit: Brandon rightfully pointed out `*_sim` isn't stored in Solr, but it should be indexed. You could search directly in Solr for `*_sim` properties and see if they respond, but that may be more work.  Edit 2: QA will probably be similar or parallel to #271 and #272. Good fields to target for search/facet testing include: - Core Metadata   - Depositor   - Title - Basic Metadata   - Creator   - Description   - Abstract   - License - Custom Metadata   - Common Name   - Species   - Award   - Former Owner Not all fields may be facetable, searchable, or both. They should align to the MAP.
