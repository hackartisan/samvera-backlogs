Allowing for an Organization to be a creator in the VDC
Currently, you can select approved users as creators of works or collections in the VDC.  We'd like change this to allow Organizations to be creators as well. An organization differs from a Person in that it does not have certain properties like a CV or an ORCID.  Also, an organization would not have a preferred name in the format of "last_name, first_name". By default, both new works and new collections have the creator pre-populated to be the current user. This will not change.  However, the current user will have the option to remove himself/herself from the creator field and choose an organization instead.  The current user can also choose to keep himself/herself as the creator and add an organization as an additional creator. In the RDF representation of the data, the VDC creator (https://datacollaboratory.org/resource#creator) will point to either a person or an organization.
Some things to think about:  * We'll need a new ActiveFedora::Base object to represent the organization. * We'll need a registration and approval process for the organization. * We'll need to decide whether or not the user in charge of an organization also be able to keep his or her own separate account in addition to the account representing the organization. * We'll need to change the related views, controllers. * We'll need to add solr indexing and search building.
