Decide on remaining CSV columns
While working on #481, I used this file as an example CSV: dlcs_ladnn_20190318_manual_edit.csv . The example CSV contains several columns that the importer currently doesn't use.  In the past, the importer ignored those columns, but now we have a validator that will reject those columns. For each of these columns, decide if we should delete the column from the CSV file, or if we should update the importer to import that column:   Object Type - will be added to the importer as part of story #436  Item Title - should be deleted from the CSV file, per #481  Alternate Identifier.url  Description.abstract  Item Sequence  Name.architect  Relation.hasVersion  Rights.permission  thumbnailImageName
