Citations for journal articles
Ref gwu-libraries/scholarspace#254 The work for this ticket is to:  Determine how item metadata can be created for items which are individual articles from serial publications (see link above for example), in a way that results in a correct citation -- if this is even possible. If not possible with current (2.x) Hyrax, consider submitting a ticket and/or contributing an enhancement.  Also ref #77
Should not result in incorrect citations for other content types, for example:  1. Faculty Senate minutes https://scholarspace.library.gwu.edu/files/wm117p00q  2. International Teamster https://scholarspace.library.gwu.edu/files/cn69m420z
