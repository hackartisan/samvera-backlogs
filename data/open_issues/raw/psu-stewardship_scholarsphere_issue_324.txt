User Story: List of colleges represented via faculty and student 
As a service manager, I want to be able to see a list of colleges represented via faculty and student content in ScholarSphere, in descending order, so that when I do outreach I can share these statistics as part of promoting the service.
@patriciahswe @mahirakgun Did you want the Number of Students & the number of Faculty deposits separated?  How about staff?  Is the college represented by anything in PSU ldap? Here are the ldap records for you Patricia, and our current featured researcher.  ``` Name: PATRICIA M HSWE E-mail: pmh22@psu.edu Phone: +1 814 867 3702 Title: DIGTL CONTENT STRATEGIST Address: 0311 PATTEE LIBRARY UNIVERSITY PARK UNIVERSITY PARK, PA 16802 Campus: UNIVERSITY PARK Department: SCHOLARLY COMM OPERATIONS Administrative Area: UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES ```  ``` Name: LAURA GUERTIN E-mail: uxg3@psu.edu Phone: +1 610 892 1427 Title: PROFESSOR EARTH SCIENCES Address: 0102 MAIN BUILDING BRANDYWINE MEDIA, PA 19063 Campus: BRANDYWINE Department: SCIENCE Administrative Area: PS BRANDYWINE ```
