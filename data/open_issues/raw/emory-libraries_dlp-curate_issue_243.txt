UI for Preservation Workflows and Events
Story As a Repository Administrator or Preservation Curator, I want to initiate or monitor system-generated Preservation Workflows and Events, so that I can perform and verify preservation acts that the system is performing Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes This epic describes user interface needs for working with the approved Preservation Events and Workflows specs provided by the Digital Preservation FRG. Some events are system-initiated and system managed, but others are run on request. Workflow instances can receive manual notes and rights metadata assignments. All outcomes are logged to a single preservation log per work.
