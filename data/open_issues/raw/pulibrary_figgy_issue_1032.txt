Migrate Milberg plates to SimpleResource objects
There are a set of JPEGs in an Omeka exhibit for Milberg located at http://libphp-dev.princeton.edu/milberg. We'd like to migrate these plates to Figgy so we can stop maintaining that old Omeka site. These plates should show up in DPUL. Write a migration script against the Omeka-xml API to create SimpleResource objects.
@kevinreiss will have info for accessing the metadata and files, possibly via an Omeka API or JSON dump
The current Omeka (running v 2.6) is at http://libphp-dev.princeton.edu/milberg. Each "book" is an Omeka Collection Type with the individual plates represented as Items. The REST API gives you basic information on each type, https://omeka.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Reference/api/index.html. API root endpoint is http://libphp-dev.princeton.edu/milberg/api/. The API is a bit basic if you are an authenticated user Omeka will dump out a lot more information about the collection (including ordered Items attached to that collection) or item with these JSON views.  http://libphp-dev.princeton.edu/milberg/admin/collections/show/158?output=omeka-xml http://libphp-dev.princeton.edu/milberg/admin/items/show/1588?output=omeka-xml  You might also want to look at the Omeka-S new release that includes an Omeka 2 importer module that might have some useful pointers at an easy way to migrate data. High Quality JPEGs just reside in the "original" directory in the Omeka install's files directory. The ~~JSON~~ XML views above provide URLs for the each item's files. 
@kevinreiss I get errors when I try to reach those JSON views. I can reach http://libphp-dev.princeton.edu/milberg/admin/ so it doesn't appear to be an authentication problem.
Sorry, apparently the later version of Omeka the site is running (2.6) provides only an "omeka-xml" version of the detailed object dump. The 2.0 version the site was running until yesterday would send back json. I guess it was deprecated at some point. 
Need metadata
