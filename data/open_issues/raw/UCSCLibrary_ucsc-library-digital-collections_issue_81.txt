Issues with several individual files for Hitchcock recordings
Several works in the 1976-77 History of Western Civ collection are not playing on the object pages. Not playing means, I hit play and nothing happens. In the multiple track player on the main page, the wrong lecture plays when one of these records is selected.  My suggestion is to unpublish the problematic recordings and troubleshoot them later.  When I hit the edit button on those works, the system displays the error message: "We're sorry, but something went wrong. If you are the application owner check the logs for more information."

The problematic works are: Track 3 (plays GD answering machine) http://digitalcollections.library.ucsc.edu/concern/parent/sx61dm30x/lectures/4t64gn212  Track 13 (doesn't play, displays object icon instead of audio icon) http://digitalcollections.library.ucsc.edu/concern/parent/sx61dm30x/lectures/3197xm063  Track 14 http://digitalcollections.library.ucsc.edu/concern/parent/sx61dm30x/lectures/z603qx43s Track 15 http://digitalcollections.library.ucsc.edu/concern/parent/sx61dm30x/lectures/1c18df79x  Track 16 http://digitalcollections.library.ucsc.edu/concern/parent/sx61dm30x/lectures/4f16c2831  Track 23 http://digitalcollections.library.ucsc.edu/concern/parent/sx61dm30x/lectures/h702q641c  Track 24 http://digitalcollections.library.ucsc.edu/concern/parent/sx61dm30x/lectures/ww72bb527  Track 25 http://digitalcollections.library.ucsc.edu/concern/parent/sx61dm30x/lectures/6q182k13s  Track 26 http://digitalcollections.library.ucsc.edu/concern/parent/sx61dm30x/lectures/2z10wq25s  Track 27 (plays, not Hitchcock though) http://digitalcollections.library.ucsc.edu/concern/parent/sx61dm30x/lectures/4x51hj03c  Track 31 http://digitalcollections.library.ucsc.edu/concern/parent/sx61dm30x/lectures/q524jn78d  Track 32 http://digitalcollections.library.ucsc.edu/concern/parent/sx61dm30x/lectures/r494vk192
