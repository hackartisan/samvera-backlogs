Event - Format Identification
Story As a Preservation Curator, I want to use Format Identification service such as FITS and see its outputs as Technical Metadata or a supplemental file, so that I can determine file format and version information for files within a digital object Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes Relates to separate epics/enhancements: #208 for Metadata Extraction Event Links to Additional Information Approved Preservation Events & Workflows Preservation - Metadata Properties Needed File & FileSet/Technical Metadata List of all Preservation UI Mockups Checklist   Event outcomes should be recorded in the Preservation Log using standard events/workflow metadata  Selected metadata is indexed for staff use [EPIC TBD]  If identification fails: record which files failed and record no format identified; notify staff depositors of the failure. self-depositors should not be notified  Record which tool was used for format identification  Record which format was identified for each file  Can be run as part of an Accession or Ingest workflow  May be associated with additional workflows in future releases  May be run on demand outside of a workflow  Given/When/Then  Given (some context) and (some other optional context) When (some action is carried out) Then (a set of observable consequences should occur)
