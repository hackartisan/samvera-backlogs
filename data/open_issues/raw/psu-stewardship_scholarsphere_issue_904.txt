Feature / Unfeature link behavior likely not working as intended
For each record, there is a menu consisting of Analytics, Edit, Delete, and Feature/Unfeature links. When clicking Feature, the text changes to Featured but loses the outline and the formatting changes. Is this the behavior that we want for this element? After a refresh the text changes to Unfeature and regains the outline and original formatting, however, clicking the link again provides no context that the operation has been successful as the interface does not change. Refreshing the page changes the Unfeature link back to Feature.
