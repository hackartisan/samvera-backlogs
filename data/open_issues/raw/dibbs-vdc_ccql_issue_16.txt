[Bug] Logged in as someone else
From Ron: When I accessed the VDC prototype on my laptop, I was already logged in as Rob at Penn state.  I logged out and logged back in as myself.  Not sure how this could have happened.
Clarification after talking to Ron: Ron was running an older version of the application, initially.  Ron logged in and did not  log off. A few days later, I deployed changes to the application (dev), and I wiped the sqlite3 DB, Solr index, Redis, and Fedora repository.  When Ron went to the updated application, he did not log in. Instead, he was already logged in as Rob from Penn State.    I'm guessing that Ron's session information was maintained and then somehow mapped to Rob's when the new application was deployed. I really don't know enough about Devise to know how this might have happened, but just adding clarification here. 
I was able to reproduce this.  I created a user A with the application and logged in.  I then killed my browser and wiped out my tmp/solr* directory, tmp/fcrepo* directory, db/development.sqlite3, and flushed redis. Then, I started up my application from scratch again, and created a user B using a second browser.  I started up my first browser and restored my windows.  After refreshing, I was logged on as user B.  I'm not sure how to fix it yet.
