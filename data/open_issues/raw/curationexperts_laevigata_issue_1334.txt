Duplicate predicate: graduation_year and graduation_date
ISSUE There are two attributes mapped to the same predicate http://purl.org/dc/terms/issued.  One appears to be multiple and one appears to be singular.  It's unclear how and when one or the other should be used. graduation_date:	["Summer 2019"] graduation_year:	"Summer 2019" ACCEPTANCE   Remove one of the attributes OR  Add use notation to https://github.com/curationexperts/laevigata/blob/master/app/models/schemas/emory_etd_schema.rb#L8-L12
