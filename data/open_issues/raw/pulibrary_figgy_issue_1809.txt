Address RuboCop exclusions
There are a number of RuboCop cops that have a large number of exclusions, e.g.:  Metrics/BlockLength Metrics/ClassLength Metrics/MethodLength  And a few cops with fewer exclusions, but the cops are indicators of complexity that should be addressed, e.g.:  Metrics/AbcSize Metrics/CyclomaticComplexity  We should either refactor the code to satisfy RuboCop, or decide that we don't care about the metric and disable it (or configure a higher threshold if appropriate)
I think there are times when length is bad and times when it's fine, like your method is a long array definition or similar. it would be good to look through them but I'd vote for keeping it as an exclusion even if the list is long.  I agree it would be good to look at the complexity ones.
