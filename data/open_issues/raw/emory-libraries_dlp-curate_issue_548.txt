Assign Rose groups to Langmuir and Yellowbacks Collections
See the Collection and Groups worksheet from epic #275. The Langmuir and Yellowbacks collections are accessible to specified Rose users. The Yearbooks collection is shared by both Rose and Oxford users, so will contain group assignments from both (see separate ticket).   Assign appropriate permissions from the spreadsheet to each group for the Langmuir Collection  Assign appropriate permissions from the spreadsheet to each group for the Yellowbacks Collection  Removing permissions for other users/groups from those Collections  Update DCE's collection automation task  Discuss long term collection maintenance through UI (e.g. Collection Managers will want to update their Collection metadata manually over time)
@devanshu-m I'm not sure if this ticket is complete according to the checkbox items above?  For Langmuir, I manually added the Repository Manager group which was missing, but I don't know if this needs to be updated in the automation tasks?  Yellowbacks does not have any Rose groups assigned.
