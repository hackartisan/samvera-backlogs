Cool URIs / Semantic URLs
As a remote researcher, I would like objects to have a sensible URL displayed in the browser, So that it's the briefest URL to the object. I.e.: This (https://scholarsphere.psu.edu/37720c880) instead of this (https://scholarsphere.psu.edu/concern/generic_works/37720c880)
Good piece on this: [www.hanselman.com/blog/URLsAreUI.aspx](www.hanselman.com/blog/URLsAreUI.aspx)
For MVP, take out _concern_ and use human-readable object types, for example _works_ instead of _generic_works_
