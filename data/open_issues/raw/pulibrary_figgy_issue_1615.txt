@cwulfman This looks like https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/7649172 â€” Veridian?
Yes -- Thomas Keenan hand-processed this title a few years ago, but we could never figure out exactly where to put it.
Do we have Alto for these? I didn't think we did. Could they go into figy as an MVW?
Let me see if I can find the METS/ALTO for it.
