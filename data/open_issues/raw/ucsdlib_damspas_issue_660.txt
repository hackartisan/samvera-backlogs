Allow for different sorting scenarios on a collection by collection basis
Descriptive summary Kirk W. is requesting the option to be able to change the default sort on a collection by collection basis. Would this have to be hard coded or would we need to add a flag to the collection metadata for this purpose? Rationale The Holocaust Living History Workshop's default sort makes more sense to list as most recently added (sort by date created, descending). Related issues  #644
@gamontoya - Here's some early feeback since I'm going through the backlog looking for work and noticed this :)  > Would this have to be hard coded or would we need to add a flag to the collection metadata for this purpose?  It would have to be explicitly supplied somewhere. Since this is a front-end concern, I think we could probably store the information in a local configuration file in damspas, so DOMM wouldn't have to create a new predicate and add the metadata to the record itself.  That would mean a request to change the sort for a collection would require a deploy, though perhaps there's a way to read that configuration file from an external location, similar to how the homepage image feed works. Either way, long story short, it's _possible_  > to be able to change the default sort on a collection by collection basis.  This seems like something that should have some user experience discussion. The rationale Kirk uses makes sense, however I think there's a possibility here that this introduces more confusion for users because search result display would no long be consistent across collections. Perhaps something to run by DUS?
I have no idea how I closed this.
