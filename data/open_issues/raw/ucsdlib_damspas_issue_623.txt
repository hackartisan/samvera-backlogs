@gamontoya Why close this ticket? I remember our discussion yesterday is to explore the Ruby way to add watermark to PDF , and if it is possible will replace python script with it as long term solution? Is that right?
Yes, but this is an R&D ticket so I was going to create a new ticket with the official task. I'll just re-write this ticket.
Got it @gamontoya
