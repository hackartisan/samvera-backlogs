remove giant note on public visibility
(in edit form)
This was just teed up for us in hyrax  https://github.com/projecthydra-labs/hyrax/pull/436/files
@hackmastera Does that mean we don't want to bother doing it now in sufia? If so, do you think it's okay to close this?
I guess I figured we would override the template in the meantime. But I won't cry if we close it for now.
Is this still needed? Seems low priority or possibly even unnecessary now. @catlu and @hackmastera?
I think it's low-pri, and will become trivially easy once we get onto hyrax.
Ok. I guess I won't close it, but I'll move it back to backlog. Once we have a post-Hyrax milestone it can go there!
