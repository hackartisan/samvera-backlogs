Create Curate works and attach book files from digitization workflow outputs
Story As a Library Staff Depositor, I want to batch-ingest book objects generated from multiple book digitization workflows using a supplied file mapping, so that I can create complex book objects in bulk Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes The bulk-ingest method should read from a normalized structural metadata source file to create objects mapped to the Curate generic work model (see epic #289). This epic focuses on the creation of complex objects based on supplied file manifests mapped to the Curate generic work model, which permits multiple files/derivatives per FileSet, and multiple categories of FileSets. Links to Additional Information Related epic #273: bulk ingest process Related epic ###: generate file manifests for Curate bulk ingest: books Related: file transfer Pull-lists Checklist   As part of the larger bulk ingest process, objects are created in bulk from a supplied book object and file mapping manifest  Files are retrieved from a designated upload directory and copied to permanent storage if needed  Files are attached to batch-created works and assigned to their appropriate preservation context using the LIMB or Kirtas SIP mapping  Book objects generated can be either flat (single-volume) or nested (multiple volumes attached to a parent work)  Image objects generated are assigned to a primary collection entity in Curate  Image objects generated are assigned to a primary Admin Set entity in Curate  Image objects generated in batch can be opened and edited using the Curate edit work form  Interoperates with related metadata extraction processes (extract from Alma, extract from pull-list)  Creation of objects and assignment of files interoperates with standard Curate preservation events and workflows and logging  Given/When/Then  Given (some context) and (some other optional context) When (some action is carried out) Then (a set of observable consequences should occur)
