User Story for download statistics
As a service manager of ScholarSphere, I need to know how often items have been downloaded in the past week / month / year, so I can show impact as part of promoting the service.
Is the google analytic report for file downloads enough? https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#report/content-event-events/a33252017w60487619p61852754/%3F_u.date00%3D20160501%26_u.date01%3D20160710%26explorer-table.secSegmentId%3Danalytics.eventAction%26explorer-table.plotKeys%3D%5B%5D/
