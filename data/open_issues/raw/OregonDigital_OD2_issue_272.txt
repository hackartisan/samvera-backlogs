[3] Enable searching for labels in catalog controller.
Descriptive summary There will be some extra work involved to configure the system to search the controlled fields properly. Verify that all the searching works for each field. that means searching throughout the system, review page, search bar, facets, etc.
@wickr Pointed out this still needs configuration for `config.add_search_field`
QA: In all expected search fields/pages:  - [x] Can still search on core metadata  - [x] Can search on some obscure custom metadata  - [x] Searches work for labels for controlled field metadata and not the URI  - [x] Cannot search on metadata marked not searchable by MAP
QA blocked by #463 
QA Fail - MAP indicated field Specimen Type should be non-searchable but it is.  Please check all searchable, facetable, etc. fields of MAP and compare with current configuration.

@CGillen @straleyb - I don't know if either one of you can take a look at this today (and I'm not expecting that!), but I wanted to flag Sarah's notes above about pass/fail. Unless I hear otherwise, I'm going to move this to WC7 at the close of this WC. 
@straleyb @CGillen Metadata did QA on this at the very end of WC 6. There a few items above that need review, so we've it back to the Ready column. This is related to #397 that was also moved back to Ready.
