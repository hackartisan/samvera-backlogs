For AV materials, the UV title should be the title of the playlist in addition to the track

This seems like the same issue as https://github.com/pulibrary/orangelight/issues/1283 â€” when we have multi-part manifests, we'd like the viewer title to be the top-level (collection) title, not the volume/track/part/etc. title.
Similar, but MVWs do that because it's a collection and the top level just loads the lower level. AV is just a manifest and it does that just because.
