Looks like we are getting failing jobs each time we deploy
on 2016/01/29 there were about 600 errors There were around 20 on the other days. Not sure what all the errors are about but it seems bad that there were so many.  Does anyone else remember?

@cam156 the fetch error is for a user whose email doesn't resolve when going to SHARE. 
It looks like LDAP may be getting cranky being hit too much, becuase if I run these jobs individually they run. 
Weird. Why would they fail on the same record? Can you get the job to run with https://scholarsphere.psu.edu/files/8623j753j ? But, now that I check, it was successfully sent to Share... so who knows.
