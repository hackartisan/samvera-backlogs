Prepend 'Creative Commons' and/or add license code to CC rights labels
Right now when we use a Creative Commons license, the label that comes through is something like "Attribution 4.0 International"  which is accurate and good, but may not be obvious it's a CC license. I propose adjusting the label we save and index into something like: "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)" (That's actually basically the 'label' we have listed on the Copyright page) I think this would only require a small tweak to the saving/indexing code, and then a reindex of items with CC licenses.
