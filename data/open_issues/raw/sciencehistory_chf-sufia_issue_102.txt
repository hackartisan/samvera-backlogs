Data validation: umbrella issue
Bit more discussion needed before beginning. There are a variety of other GH Issues related, most in 'backlog'. needed a place for general notes / documentation. Some links that came up via IRC conversation 11/3/15:  https://github.com/aic-collections/aicdams-lakeshore/blob/master/app/models/concerns/validations.rb https://github.com/aic-collections/aicdams-lakeshore/blob/master/app/models/generic_file.rb https://github.com/aic-collections/aicdams-lakeshore/blob/master/app/models/resource.rb https://github.com/projecthydra/active_fedora/blob/master/lib/active_fedora/validations.rb http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html
Okay I've looked through this.  ActiveFedora validations are included as part of ActiveFedora::Base so anything we do should run through there.   Use validates: to do pre-fab validations (such as the ones listed in the rails guide); use validate: to define custom validations; here's a good example of that in sufia: https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia/blob/fa0190067b76f825d2e017ceb1dca7fb95cbe250/sufia-models/lib/sufia/permissions/writable.rb  Not sure really whether we should split validations out into their own file; probably makes sense if it's going to be long. Looks like tests should still go in the model spec. 
All validation-related tickets should be tagged with "validation" so they show up under https://github.com/sciencehistory/chf-sufia/labels/validation
Thanks @eddierubeiz @jrochkind! I'll review the existing tickets so we can start setting some priorities going forward.
