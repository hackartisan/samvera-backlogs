Ingest "Brittle books" (pudl0119)
Notes: (w/ Vendor) These don't seem to be displayed anywhere. Migrate? Also, what does "w/ Vendor" mean? Ping @joycebcat @jpstroop
@roelmoon mentioned there were ~140 titles ready to ingest, and I see roughly that many in the `pudl/pudl0119` directory.  I think these should be bulk ingested.
Yes, as far as I know these should be ingested.
I'm bulk-ingesting these now, and will run a script to set the visibility by date once they're loaded (this is available in the ingest forms, but not in the bulk ingest Rake task) 
There are now 150 items in the Brittle Books collection:  https://figgy.princeton.edu/?f%5Bmember_of_collection_titles_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Brittle+Books  I've made the post-1924 items private with the rights statement "In Copyright", but otherwise these are not improved (e.g., the pages aren't numbered, not displayed 2-up, etc.).  Should I just bulk-complete these, or can we get someone to number pages, etc.?
Forgot to mention one more wrinkle: one item has a non-existent or suppressed bib (2826757).  I just set that item's title to the bib number.  Though it looks like it may be this item: https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/2814410
