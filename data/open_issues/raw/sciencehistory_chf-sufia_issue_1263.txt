Honeybadger comments are not working
The 500 error page has a form for user comments which are supposed to be displayed alongside the error on the Honeybadger error page site. The form accompanying error https://app.honeybadger.io/projects/53196/faults/50666664 was filled out but the comments appear to have been lost. Should be possible to reproduce this readily.
