"Share work with other users" does not work when batch editing
When clicking on "edit selected" after selecting more than one work, then clicking on the permissions tab and granting a user edit access under "share work with other users," states that edits are saved but doesn't actually update the records with this permission status.
Revisiting this ticket since Jessica Strawn needs edit access to museum fine art objects.  Using the following facets being department: museum/format: image seem to hone in on all the records she needs edit access to.  You can also give her edit access to all the museum objects if easier.  Thank you!
Batch editing metadata fields still seems to work; just the permissions batch edits is broken per tests conducted today.
