PUDL collection: 
This collection is only two items. Neither have MARC identifiers, both have MODS metadata and links to ARKs which resolve to the relevant finding aid and the ARK to PUDL collection. The metadata in the MODS does not match the metadata for the linked finding aid.  For example, for the minutes:  Title: "Board of Trustees Minutes. Volumes I-XII" Related Finding Aid:  Metadata in MODS includes such things as:  Creator (Princeton University Trustees, split into two nameParts) AAT subject headings: Minutes, Records, Meeting, Bylaws Origin Info Date Created (1748-1796) Language code physicalDetails originInfo (Princeton, NJ) Note Custom license note:  "With the exception of bylaws, all Trustee minutes and records are closed for 50 years from the date of their       creation. Exceptions may be made only with the prior approval of University General Counsel and the University Secretary. Access to the original Volume I is restricted; researchers may" "Single photocopies may be made for research purposes. Permission to publish material from the collection must be       requested from the University Archivist. Copyright is held by the Trustees of Princeton University."  LCSH subject headings (Princeton University Trustees, Education Higher) Physical Location (Princeton University Library.

I think we're going to have to ingest these as SimpleResources, and decide if we need controlled vocabularies for them. Given that, I'm moving on to another collection for the moment.

Relatively simple except for name subjects. Can we convert it to a string "George II, King of Great Britain (1683-1760)"? If not, we may need to do that and also create a controlled vocab for it and then resolve either to LCSH or VIAF.
We'd also have to figure out what to do with "Princeton University Trustees"
I think it's fine to convert names with muliple nameParts to single strings for ingest.  We can do name reconciliation and create or link to controlled vocab records for them, and deal with the metadata needed for the entity there.
