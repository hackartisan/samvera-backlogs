introduce primary_file as an abstraction in FileSet?
The logic to check for original files vs preservation files is starting to show up in lots of places. It might help to centralize this check in a concept of primary_file. Are there down sides to this?
Related to #3329 â€” this could be a way to make it easier to check the fixity of the appropriate file.  It may also work in other cases to simplify the logic for which file to use.  Another option: * Change derivative generation to use `intermediate_file` and preservation/fixity to use `preservation_master`, and then have those fallback on `original_file` if no intermediate/preservation_master is present.
