Evaluate Asynchronous and Pub/Sub Solr Synchronization Options
One approach we could take to synchronizing Solr across Californica & Ursus is to treat Ursus as a Californica "observer" or "subscriber". Ursus would consume updates from Californica and maintain its own index. This is timeboxed to a maximum 1 developer week. This work is to describe the options along these lines for the larger evaluation in #205:   write up a high level description of this architectural option  describe technical implementation options related to this approach  add initial pros/cons of this approach for short and long term project goals.  Bonus:   Prototype an ursus consumer for Fedora's built-in message streams  Prototype a Hyrax-side observer->job or pub/sub publisher.
