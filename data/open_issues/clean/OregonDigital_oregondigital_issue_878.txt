Mongolian Altai Inventory Collection Start Over links missing
Esther has found that the Start Over link at the top of a record is missing if she searches for a specific object and gets a single hit. Is it possible to have the Start Over link visible and take one back to the collection homepage in such cases? It's a bit confusing.
 I see what you're saying. If she starts searching from the MAIC page and does a search with a single item, such as this:     then "Mongolian Altai Inventory Collection" above the image title is a link back to the collection page. But if it's a direct search from the OD homepage then that won't be there.  The link in the metadata fields for Set of MAIC is basically a browse all, so that might also help. 
I think there's a real bug here - from the landing page, the form tag is `<form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="/sets/maic" class="search-query-form form-inline clearfix" method="get">`.  From an item's detail view, however, the form tag is `<form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="/" class="search-query-form form-inline clearfix" method="get">`.  Note the difference in action values.
