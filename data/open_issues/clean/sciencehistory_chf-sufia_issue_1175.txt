Bug: attempting to delete a fileset when it's already in the process of being deleted
Deleting a fileset takes some time â€” If the fileset is one of dozens attached to a work (e.g. Ramelli), it will often take well over a minute. Further requests to delete a fileset that is already in the process of being deleted should be handled gracefully.

Thanks for diagnosing. This is probably gonna be really hard to fix. 
Likely.  Also worth noting: - the fileset does eventually end up getting deleted anyway in all cases - none of this affects the non-logged-in user
