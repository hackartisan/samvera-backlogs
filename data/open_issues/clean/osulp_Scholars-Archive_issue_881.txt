Add email notification when ScholarsArchive::HandleErrorLoggingService logs an error
It would be useful to notify an administrator via ENV['SCHOLARSARCHIVE_ADMIN_EMAIL'] when one of these errors gets logged. That way we dont have to try to keep checking in on the log files to see when these errors are being logged.
not sure we still need this.   can either of you see when the last time we had one of these errors on SA Hyrax?
