Schedule a full reindex on a frequent / regular basis
So we can see any errors in honeybadger and improve the index-ready state of the data.
once a week? what day?
Once a week seems like the right frequency â€” and I would look at analytics to see when our lowest traffic times are.
we should consider when OL schedules solr jobs, too, and avoid having both apps index at the same time.
