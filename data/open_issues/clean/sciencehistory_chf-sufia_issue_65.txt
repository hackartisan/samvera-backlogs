AAT autocomplete for Medium field
This will probably need more discussion. It looks like use of Getty APIs require a license, and the Medium field is low priority for now.
Just discovered that it's not documented in the README but QA does have an AAT wrapper so this should be simple to implement if we figure out the license question. A person in my code club has been working with Getty TGN so I can ask her about licensing if you think that would be helpful. 
  There doesn't seem to be a clear fee structure, but licensing info says: Contact us at , subject line: Licensing, to learn the amount of the fees and terms of licenses. Please include an explanation of how you intend to use the data and whether your institution is for-profit or not-for-profit.  
look into this in future -- API costs money; alternative is data loads. For now use free-text field and see what data is entered.
