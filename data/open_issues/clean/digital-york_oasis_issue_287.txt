Changes to the help tab
Related to #282 I would like to change the information structure and content on the Help tab. Something similar to the Durham example Sebastian provided. The sections would expand when clicked on. Presumably, we can then link directly to the specific sections, for example, in the email notification.  The text under the How do I write an OASIS summary can be found in this document. The links in there are the ones currently on the help tab. The text under The admin has requested changes to my summary. What do I do? can be found in this document. The text under Information for journal editors can be found in this document. I'm still working on the information for the other section and will update later. The Requested changes and How to upload sections will likely include short instruction videos.
