Works Inherit Curated Collection Metadata
I can define fields in any collection that would be inherited by the works in the collection. We will need to distinguish between fields in the collection that are inherited by the work, and others that are not. The metadata is displayed on the work's show page, with a combination of all the metadata inherited from the collections of which the work is a part. This may change in later releases. When the works are exported, this metadata would also need to be included along with the rest of its metadata. When exported as an OAI feed, the inherited metadata is not included, only the metadata that is defined on the work itself.
  this concept came up during the Template discussion and I want to unpack what it means a bit further.  Is #161 user story for this?
No, this is not a duplicate of #161.
Since we moved away from collection-based schemas to work-based schemas, is this sitll posible? I think we might still have a need, but lower priority until actual need emerges.
 I think this is still possible. There is a schema for collections. Right now, it's just one, but we could expand that and have curated collections with their own schema. Works could be made to inherit that.  What is the nature of the inheritance? Will the inherited fields be a read-only kind of thing where the collection's metadata is displayed and exported with the work?
Thanks . You have the right idea, fields that would be displayed and exported with any work in the collection, regardless of work-type. Read-only yes, we'd have to work out how the manifest on the edit form.  We need to revisit this as a group with Linda and stakeholders for refinement, particularly in the context of working with the application without this feature and learning how beneficial this approach would be for templates and collection-wide fields.
