QA on ordered metadata fields
Descriptive summary We need to do some pretty heavy duty QA on ordered fields. The following are suggested tests: QA on ordering:    1) create new work and check showpage    2) edit work and check showpage    3) remove contents of a creator field and save - then check ordering    4) test migrated item    5) add new creator to migrated item    6) delete creator from migrated item    7) reorder creator on migrated item    ðŸ˜Ž 1 billion creators    9) batch upload with ordered creator    10) test across a few (all?) work types    11) intentionally trigger an error and then see if things are fine - trigger by leaving an Other field blank elsewhere on the form    12) check saved content of the record, not just the showpage    13) How does ordering work with the citation function?
I tested creating a batch work and got  `ActionView::Template::Error: undefined method 'abstract' for #<Hyrax::Forms::BatchUploadForm:0x00005618ff0ae1c8>`   See ticket #1689 
 I'm currently looking into ticket #1689 I think we missed the update for `batch_upload_form.rb`.
 batch uploads is now working as expected on staging. It got fixed by  and
