Versioning in OD2
Descriptive summary This ticket describes the need to refine the versioning in OD2. Currently, versioning isnt working. When you click on a work and scroll down to its filesets, there is a dropdown menu. When you click that dropdown, you will see a choice labeled "versions". Clicking that will take you to the versioning page. Once on that page, you will see the option to upload a new version of that file. When you upload the file, it says it was added, but the new file isnt presented eventhough it says it was uploaded successfully. It should be replacing the file and versioning the old file, for discoverability. However, the newer version should be the primary file displayed on that works show page. Expected behavior Uploading a new version of a file, should present that file as the default. The old file should still be attached, but versioned. Current behavior Uploading a file says it is successful, but it isnt being attached to the work and set as a default.
So, this is actually working, but the versioned file doesn't update in the UI. The new file is there, but the filename and thumbnail don't change. This is covered in a long discussion on this Hyrax ticket:
