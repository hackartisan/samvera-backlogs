Create Structured Nested Works
As a metadata specialist, I need to be able to associate the individual items/images that make up a multi-item object in a structured way, So that I can bring them together in the repository, arrange them in order, and show their relationship to the whole object.
I believe we will be able to do this in the PCDM model by default?
At some point we will  want to support nested collections and nested works, but for this ticket we will focus on nested works (this is what CONTENTdm supports)  An object can belong to multiple collections, but one collection will be considered the home collection and the other collections are likely user created.  Some additional notes that may be helpful or not: Most common relations ships are  1- objects similar to a book (book -> chapter -> page) 2- files on a filesystem We need to capture structure (where things were on disc when uploaded). We need to be able to capture hierarchical structures and the relationships of items to the parent object.    We need to be able to display to people in search results that items are part of a collection to provide additional context to our users on the search results.  Working towards metadata where children inherit the properties of the parent object and item can have more specific metadata.
Added #216 to support nested collections.  This ticket is only for compound works
<dl><dt>Structured Nested Works</dt> <dd>Structured works are nested works with file groupings to provide additional structure, such as sections or chapters.  Structured works may also represent born-digital archival collections.</dd></dl>  Examples:   * a digitized book, with sections such as front matter, table of contents, chapters, and index   * a born digital collection with subdirectories  We need to decide is this is MVP 2 or MVP 3. Initially wasn't veiwing this as MVP at all, but this will be required for production use. Probably good to get it in early for testing as we have lots of these in CONTENTdm. (Not that they couldn't be simplified, sometimes this is a nice but not necessary thing that helps patrons navigate obects.)  Done looks like:   [ ] Stuff   [ ] Users are able to navigate by structured sections while viewing the object. 
Structured works will differ from regular compound objects in that the nesting will be multiple layers deep: folders within folders, and items. There will also be additional requirements for display that might not apply for regular compound works.
