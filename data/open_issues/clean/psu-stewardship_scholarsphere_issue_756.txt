Cap whenever schedule task links to scripts stored on the server
These two lines break our current mold for keeping the scripts in git.   and I noticed this when updating for the new servers. Not sure if this was done for a reason, or it was just done before we ket the scripts in git.  We need to evaluate  this and determine if it is needed.  
If the opportunity presents itself, I'd like to work on this ticket. Assigning myself for now, can be reassigned later if needed.
