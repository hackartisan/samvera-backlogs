CVE-2015-9284
How are we feeling about CVE-2015-9284? I've been watching the omni-auth repo comments, but no fix is forthcoming. There is a gem that mitigates this vulnerability:  Implementation: brave-intl/publishers#1942 Is this worth trying, or should we wait for an official fix?
I was trying to be optimistic, but  doesn't appear to be moving ahead.  DCE is using that Gem for repository projects: 
My understanding of this vulnerability is that it requires an OAuth provider with another CSRF vulnerability in order to exploit the vulnerability.  That is, the OAuth provider's vulnerability would be used to inject forged headers into Figgy.  Based on that understanding, I think our exposure here is very small.  We do use OAuth for authorizing Google Drive support (and we also use it as the main auth mechanism in cicognara).  But the overwhelming majority of our users aren't using Google Drive support at all, and those that do use it don't need to re-auth all the time.  So I think the circumstances where this attack could even arise are pretty rare in Figgy.  If that is all true, then I'm fine waiting for an official fix.  I'm open to using that external CSRF fix, but I'd want to know why Omniauth isn't just merging the fix.
