Batch upload to hyrax v2.1.0 from within a collection fails
Track this issue.
This is still broken in v2.4.1 and v3.0.0.pre.beta1 How can we just remove the following line "To create a separate work for each of the files, go to Batch upload" from the "Add new work" form?
It would be worth seeing how it renders if we just remove the text for `batch_link` and `batch_upload_hint` by replacing them with "" in hyrax.en.yml. Otherwise, we'll need to start customizing files to remove it entirely.  
Do you know how to edit  to make that happen? 
I'm failing to hide that in the form by editing hyrax.en.yml I may have indentations incorrect. 
Copying and editing the following in my local VM for now. 
Even better, copying line from 3.0.0.pre.beta1 _form.html.erb makes editing hyrax.en.yml work to hide this line. ```<p class="switch-upload-type"><%= t('.batch_upload_hint') %> <%= link_to t('.batch_link'), hyrax.new_batch_upload_path %></p>```
