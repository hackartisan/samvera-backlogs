Update BrowseEverything to 1.0 to support DropBox APIv2
Dropbox has deprecated their APIv1. See  The cutoff date is June 28th, 2017, and on March 28th, we'll apparently start getting warning emails. We should investigate that BE is compatible with the new API.
Update: The answer is no, BE does not support APIv2, and what's worse, the official ruby dropbox-sdk gem that BE uses does not currently have any plans to support the new API. This leaves us in a bit of a quandary.
Possibly a topic for LDCX
Ask drop box to provide support, or remove it, or write a hydra implementation. Removing it would be a last resort.
Updating BE to 1.0 will fix this.
