add IIIF manifests for pdf files
I believe that if we can have PDF files return a manifest that specifies the pdf file, we should be able to use the universal viewer for those documents and get rid of the pdfjs implementation I'm not sure if there's a way to switch this on or if it'll take some finagling. currently, pdf documents manifest as: {   "@context": "",   "@type": "sc:Manifest",   "@id": "",   "label": "Frog. III. Literature. IV. Visual arts. V. Music" } where we'd like to get them: (via:  {   "id": "",   "type": "Manifest",   "label": "Science and the Public",   "attribution": "Wellcome Library",   "sequences": [     {       "type": "Sequence",       "canvases": [         {           "id": "",           "type": "Canvas",           "content": [             {               "id": "",               "type": "AnnotationPage",               "items": [                 {                   "id": "",                   "type": "Annotation",                   "motivation": "painting",                   "body": {                     "id": "",                     "type": "PDF",                     "format": "application/pdf",                     "label": "Science and the Public"                   },                   "target": ""                 }               ]             }           ]         }       ]     }   ] }
note: this is on the radar for a hyrax 2.x release
