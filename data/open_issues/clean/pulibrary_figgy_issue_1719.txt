Ingest bayonne but keep them private with a note
It wasn't ingested initially due to confusion. It's in the ingest staging directory on the server, in the file for pudl0090 and it's called bayonne.mets
 says "ingest Bayonne and just keep it private with a note."
I guess we should keep this private via a "takedown" workflow status, and a workflow note. Not sure exactly what the note should say except that takedown was required.
Isn't it "complete" and "private" and the fact that it was taken down is just a fluke of history on us accidentally not making it private?
That makes sense! Is the note still a workflow note? Do we have any other kind of note?
