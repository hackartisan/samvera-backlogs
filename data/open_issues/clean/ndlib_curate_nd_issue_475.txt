Alternate asset deployment strategy
Now that we are minifying our JavaScript (#262) precompiling the assets takes a long time. The whole deploy process now takes long enough to cause SSH timeouts in Jenkins. We should break the asset precompiling step out into itsâ€™s own process. One way to do this would be to use AssetSync to deploy the compiled assets to S3. As a developer, I want to avoid committing compiled assets into our git repository because that clutters the repo. As a developer, I want to avoid compiling assets at deploy time, because that really slows things down.
 and I have also been discussing moving to some kind of pre-compiled deployment strategies. Maybe via RPM? That would be a more general solution and would apply to things besides Assets: the code, the assets, clearer separation between environment config vs other yml files. 
 moving assets to S3 for would be for both storage and distribution.  I have no problem with packaging the application code and dependencies using a tool like [fpm]( I will look into that as well.
