Search engine optimisation for OASIS
Not for the current sprint (maybe autumn?). Investigate and implement search engine optimisation for the website? We want to be found! :-)
 what search terms a user might use to find OASIS?  Searching for [Open Accessible Summaries in Language Studies](  gives good results [Oasis Database](  brings us in 3rd place. [OASIS language](  brings 1st place.
 That's really good! What about if people can't quite remember the name of the project and enter things like:  language learning summaries language teaching summaries etc.  Is there anything we can do for that?
SEO optimization requires lots of work, e.g. [the list from this article](    For now, we certainly can add some meta tags to OASIS, please could you provide me with a full list of the OASIS keywords? 
 You mean a full list of things people might search for?
Yes  
 Ok, thanks. I'll put a list together and check with Emma and Lisa-Maria to see if they have any additions.
 We've send the list out to the wider project team for them to comment on. I'll will send it to you next week when they have had a chance to respond.
 You can find the list [here]( 
 I'm trying to add more specific meta keywords for each summary detail page. What fields are the best source for these keywords, topic, participant type?
 I'm not entirely sure what you mean. I think topic would be most informative as it's the most specific field we have.
