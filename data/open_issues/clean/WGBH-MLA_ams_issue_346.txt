Create new "Staging" env (to replace current "Staging") by copying "Edge" env.
User Story As a Developer I have an up-to-date environment to run benchmarks in order to present at Samvera Connect (w/ poster) Additional Information Since we're still lacking fully functioning deployment deployment apparatus, the plan is to copy the "most correct" env, which is the "Edge" env. Done Looks Like A working copy of the "edge" environment that replaces current "staging" environment.
**EDIT** Took quite a different tack than when this ticket was originally created.  Tweaked CloudFormation template and `install.sh` used by CodeDeploy to successfully build an environment that looks like _current_ the "Edge" instance, which is _currently_ the most successful ingesting instance we have. After many iterations, finally got it all working.  Depends on... -  -   Once ☝️ have both been merged, then this ticket can close.
