Demo DOI generation for embargoed works once Hyrax 2.0.0 is released
Once Hyrax 2.0.0 is released, we should revisit the DOI generation for embargoed works. We need to make sure that DOI is generated properly if the visibility of a work is open/public once the embargo ends. This is related to Issue #49.
NOTE: In Hyrax 2.0.0, the embargo and lease management pages are not linked to the UI. However, you can find them in the dev environment here:  localhost:3000/embargoes localhost:3000/leases
Note with Grace and Ron:  We need to look at embargoes and leases and understand what a user experiences.
