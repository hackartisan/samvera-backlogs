Separate Public UI and Admin UI
As a logged-in, non-system user, I would like to see a menu/dashboard that has options applicable to me, So that I can easily manage my CHO activities. Activities that I need to manage include: log in/log out, file management for metadata and content, (#89, #74, #21, #36, #90, #131, #136, #210), set UI language (#163), tag management (#35), annotation management (#147), transcription management (#8), bookmarks, history, and manage my collections (#23).  As a logged-in, system user, I would like to see a menu/dashbaord that has options applicable to me, So that I can easily manage my CHO activities. The Hyrax admin dashboard can be used as wireframes to speedup the design process, but implemented in an accessible way. (The collections section may be accessible?) Activites that I need to manage include: log in, log out, booksmarks, history, creating/editing/deleting collections, creating/editing/deleting works, creating/editing/deleting agents, activity streams by collection/work-type/library/creator, manage users and groups, monitor batch activities, manage works I submitted, manage collections I am responsible for, etc. Some of these activities will be defined by the system user role and permissions. For example, if they are a system user who only has permissions to submit to one collection, they should only see menu options relating to managing works they submitted to that collection.  As a public user who is not logged in, I would like to see a menu that has option applicable to me, So that I can easily manage my CHO activities. Activities that I need to manage include: bookmarks and history.
