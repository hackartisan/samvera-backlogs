Revisit batch edit to resolve the difficult metadata fields
Descriptive summary There are a few metadata fields in our application that do not work in the batch edit.  The primary reason for them not working is that the singular fields and hyrax 2 assumes all metadata fields are repeatable. Add College Add Program / Department Add Description Add Date Created Add Alternate Title Add Geo Subject Add Note Add License Expected behavior That all of these fields display something and then saving values during batch edit.
One change we considered is removing the description field from batch edit.  There is concern that it's too easy for users to accidentally wipe out their existing descriptions when they edit multiple works at once.  We should get the opinions of the product owners.
