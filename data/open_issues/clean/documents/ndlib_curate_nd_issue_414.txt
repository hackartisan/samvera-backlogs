Typo in relationship between groups and the objects which they can edit
Currently: hydramata-rel:isiEditorGroupOf Should be: hydramata-rel:isEditorGroupOf Before remediating,  and I need to figure out if it's even being used, whether it's a good idea to continue use, etc. The solution may be to eliminate this inverse relationship and just use the relationship on the child, which is the object being edited anyway.
