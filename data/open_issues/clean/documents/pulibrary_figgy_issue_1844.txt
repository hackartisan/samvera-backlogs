Allow for thumbnails that are not directly mapped to object filesets
This could be a cropped portion of a fileset image (along with appropriate in-Figgy tools for cropping). Possibly allow for the upload of a thumbnail image that may not appear at all in the object as well, such as an author/creator portrait. Use case from Tom V. (via Slack):  The example I am thinking of is bib #7152095.  This is a scroll, and in PUDL it had a thumbnail image which was just a portion of the overall image (which looked much better, given the dimensions of them item).  There are others like this one.
