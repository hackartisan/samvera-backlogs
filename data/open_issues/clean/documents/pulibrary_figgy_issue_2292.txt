Can't remove imported metadata
If I create a ScannedResource with imported metadata, I can't remove it.  I can go to the form, remove the source_metadata_identifier, and enter a title, but the title will not be saved and the title from the old imported metadata will be used.
What's the use case?
The main place I've seen this is Cicognara volumes that were ingested with a BibID, but then we move them to be children of a multi-volume work.  The main reason to move the existing object instead of reingesting is if someone's spent time creating a structure for the object.
Makes sense. Should be easy
