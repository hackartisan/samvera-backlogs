Change Publisher values to URIs, add Creator controlled vocabulary class to Publisher
Publisher is not set to a controlled vocabulary class, so any time URIs are used they don't show up. Check to make sure we don't have existing data in collections that includes both URIs and strings.
Items with Publisher: * Total: 8425 * UO: 729 * OSU: 6682   * Rocky Shore 93: 300   * Middle East Waters: 5235   * SCARC: 1108   * Daily Barometer: 37 
Removing LCSH from this predicate; remediate to LCNAF, ULAN, and ON:Publisher.
this seems to be it for UO: oregondigital:fx71cj478	Free Men Speak, Inc.	 oregondigital:fx71cq835	N. J. Bocquet	 
UO records updated.
in addition to loc names, opns creator and publisher, I found just a few using:  and one of these  (oregondigital:df70bv78t)
  Can you scrape the loc orgs for me?
Finished with the loc orgs and wikidata entries. Replaced URIs with ones from authorized sources
