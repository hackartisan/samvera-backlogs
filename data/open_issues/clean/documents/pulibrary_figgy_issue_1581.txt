Ingest Western Americana (pudl0017)
Notes: MODS for photos, MARC for Albums; WC54 and 55 have album-level MARC and photo-level MODS :-( Details:  Depends on #1675 Depends on #1674
Files: 
I think we should split this into an epic. The files are split into sub-sections:  8892958: We can just ingest it. c0199: We can just ingest this. c0622: We can just ingest it c0938: We can just ingest it c1353: We can ingest it c1357: We can ingest it C1398: We can ingest it C1407: We can ingest it wc004: We can ingest it WC054: This needs its own ticket. WC055: This needs its own ticket. WC064: This needs its own ticket.
  What does "cxxxx" and "wcxxxx" signify?
I blew up each sub-section into individual tickets in case some of the albums have complex viewing use cases.
 You mean the "c" and "wc" in front of the numbers?  Those are part of the collection numbers assigned by Rare Books.  I always assumed the "c" was for collection.  I just called 5 RB people to ask for details but I can't get anybody this morning.
 Yeah. If it doesn't have some special significance we have to deal with then I won't worry about it.
Yeah, I've already just assumed they were different series of accession numbers. The info should be carried forward, but I don't think there's a need to parse it in any special way.  -Js  Sent via mobile.
