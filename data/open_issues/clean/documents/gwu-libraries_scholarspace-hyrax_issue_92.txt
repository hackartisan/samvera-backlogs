Internet Explorer 11 Compatibility View display problems
When viewing with the IE Compatibility View setting enabled, the site appears almost as though on a mobile device: (ignore the left half of each screen shot, this is an artifact of taking the screenshot)   As per this thread  others have verified that this is an issue with both Hyrax 1.x and 2.x.
Suggestion from  :   _Put this tag immediately below the opening `<head>` tag: `<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />`_
