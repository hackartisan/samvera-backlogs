What's the difference between a "Collection" and an "Archival Media Collection"?
Names have been based on what kind of workflow things are going thorough; and what models we're using on the back end. How can we reorganize the process?
Maybe we need a dashboard for archival ingest, to keep these models etc. separate from other kinds of collections?
