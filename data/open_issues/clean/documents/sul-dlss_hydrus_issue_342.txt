Hydrus objects that have passed the embargo date but are not complete
These objects are not complete and/or are test objects, but have passed the embargo date, which triggers an exception when trying to release it.  Not sure if we can remediate (perhaps by removing the embargo date until they are actually ready for accessioning)?         
EDIT: We now have code ( that will simply gracefully skip items that have past the embargo date but are not accessioned (like the one example above).  We should probably still clean it up in some way, but at least it won't generate error messages in the logs.
