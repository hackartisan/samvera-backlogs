Make reindex worker more robust
An error indexing a particular item should not halt the indexing of the entire repository. I see at least two ways of solving this: put an exception handler inside the loop, which logs the error and keeps going. Or make the indexing of each item its own job, and let resque do the error handling. (side note. not part of this ticket...but is there a way to only do a solr commit after indexing every N items, instead of after each item?)
I suspect the default script to reindex fedora (I think it might even be coming straight from hydra) indexes EVERYTHING in fedora into solr. This means the CurateND solr core contains information about all the Seaside items, the RBSC items, the Cathollic (sic) pamphlets, etc.  Maybe also make our reindexer smarter and to filter out items not having the given namespace.
