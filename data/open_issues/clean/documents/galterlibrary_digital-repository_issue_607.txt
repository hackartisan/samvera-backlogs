Work with sysadmins to upgrade Shibboleth SP
New version is out, time to upgrade.
In the past, have all Shibboleth upgrades be on FSMIT or was that just for the Symplectic servers?

We run and configure shib on DigitalHub, FSMIT provides and installs the packages. They wanted to run shib for Symplectic themselves.
