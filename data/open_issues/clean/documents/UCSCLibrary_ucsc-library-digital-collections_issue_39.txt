The previous solution did not fully solve the problem; all enquiries were still being sent to a single email address regardless of the user's choice.  So far, all entries in this form have been requests for special collections. Therefore, until I get a chance to actually fix this, I am going to set special collections as the primary contact form email address. They can forward to us if they get any bug reports.
