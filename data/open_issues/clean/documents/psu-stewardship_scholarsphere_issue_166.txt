Invalid user
There is a username "" in the system that looks suspicious. This might be a bug (or a hacking attempt?). We should get rid of this user and prevent its creation in the future. According to the stats page, the user was created on 5/6/2015 Also, the user page does not return an error (e.g. user not found) when an invalid user is used. For example, you can go to  and not realize that this not a valid user.
