User stats emails should not be sent on system other than prod
Stage and QA likely have the same cron jobs as prod, which means they will send out emails on the same date as prod. We should not do this.
TODO: * ensure cron job for `scholarsphere:stats:notify` only runs on the production jobs server
what we usually do is have a global bit that turns off the mailer, or use something like `mailcatcher`  are we setting email on / off in the rails config someplace? 
 No, mailler is on. I'm thinking we need to have another ENV key in `application.yml` that indicates what "environment" it is: qa, stage, prod, etc. But "environment" doesn't seem to be the right word.
I'm usually more a fan of explicit config bits, instead of guessing based off env (this seems to be a rails anitpattern though)   i.e  ``` mailer:   enabled: true ```  in `application.yml`         
there may also be a case where we want to sent the smtp server to something like mail catcher to get a view on what it _would_ have done? 
The mailer still needs to be enabled so we can test things. We can just turn off the job under config/schedule.rb:31.
