Browsable listing of administrative units and their collections
We need a page that will give a broad overview of the repository holdings. The first implementation of this page will be a hierarchical list of all the administrative units that contain items in the repository and, underneath those administrative units, list their collections. It will live at:   It should look something like this prototype. Links to administrative units and collections should resolve to appropriate facet selections in the catalog view. (Note that there may need to be an intermediate step for resolving to the catalog view as collections should have “cool” URIs, see #214.)
