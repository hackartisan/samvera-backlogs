Tests are contacting LDAP.
I think we should stop our tests from contacting LDAP. We are getting intermittent failures.  unified search {:type=>:feature} all files known user searches all Failure/Error: expect(page).to have_content("All") expected to find text "All" in "RuntimeError in HomepageController#index retry_unless could not complete successfully.

:+1: though it may be worth leaving one test that hits LDAP so that we can be sure that works as expected.
