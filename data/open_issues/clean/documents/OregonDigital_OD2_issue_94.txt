Look into kubernetes for local development
Descriptive summary Development workflow is currently all docker-based.  Production is kubernetes.  This separation means two things:  Changes to services requires two separate configuration changes, which could get out of sync Developers who need to do ops work in a pinch may not know how to do them since k8s isn't something most of us know  If we can reuse enough of the production k8s config for local dev, we could start easing devs into that flow.  We need to identify what bits of config need to be created that are development-specific We should come up with simple scripts (or at least README docs) for starting and stopping the stack  Expected behavior Devs can spin up the stack with kubernetes commands
See #121 for comments on the consideration of getting this to work
