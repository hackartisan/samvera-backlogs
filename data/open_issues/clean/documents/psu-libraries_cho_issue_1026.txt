Restricted File Sets
As a collection curator, I need to restrict access to files and file sets on a resource, but display (and index) metadata, So that the digital assets are stored with the rest of the collection, the resource is discoverable, and I can respect donor agreements or other MOUs regarding the content. No viewer or embedded file should display or play. Derivatives should be generated in case the restriction is later removed, but (if) extracted text should not be indexed. Related: #351, #1054 Example: 
## Questions  * should the file set's access rights be updated individually, via its containing work, collection, or some combination of all three? * is this restriction a new level, perhaps between _PSU Access_ and _Restricted_ where just metadata is viewable, but not content?  ## TODO  * determine feature requirements for setting and updating a file sets access rights * provide a mechanism for batch updating and/or indexing of all file sets in a work, and potentially, in a collection * use DownloadsController or other controller to restrict display of thumbnails * determine alternative thumbnail image to use for restricted content * prevent retrieval of works based on extracted text of restricted file sets (this may be difficult)
