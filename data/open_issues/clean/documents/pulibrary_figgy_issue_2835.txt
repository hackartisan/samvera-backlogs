Setting ocr_language for the parent resource in a MVW does not set the child resource ocr_langauge
Problem is described below in a note from the honeybadger issue. A potential solution to this is to disable or hide theocr_language field on parent MVW resources. Or we could propagate the value from parent to children.  The ocr language was set for the parent of a multi-volume work, but not for the children. Somehow, RunOCRJobs were triggered for all the child resource file set members and they failed because their parents did not have a language set.
