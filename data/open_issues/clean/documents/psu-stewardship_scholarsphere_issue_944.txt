Total Analytics for a work
We should be able to see FileSet total downloads and Fileset total views at the work level. Does this need to be a graph or just a number?
High level graph in ScholarSphere And a Download Button to get the graph data in csv
work_id, file_id, action, timestamp
From the work page I can download a report of all activity on the work, including work views, work downloads, files set views, and file set downloads.
