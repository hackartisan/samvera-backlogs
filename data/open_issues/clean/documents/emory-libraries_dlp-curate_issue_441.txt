Did you attach a new file through the edit page of the work?  If so, I wasn't able to reproduce this error in curate test for:   ![Screen Shot 2019-08-12 at 8.51.53 AM.png](  
-dce I experienced something similar recently - see #361, which I closed because I couldn't replicate it after a certain period of time.
-m I tested again briefly on 8/18 in curate prod - so far no duplicates! But we may need to monitor this for a few days.
-m I tested this again in curate prod (on my home machine). In Safari, I experienced the duplicate FileSets on this new work:   I then switched to Firefox, cleared cache etc. I did _not_ experience the bug on this new work:   Went back to Safari, cleared cache/history, and opened a new incognito browser session - did not experience the bug on this new work: 
 can you put this back in either backlog/queued. I am not sure what the issue is here but I could see in the database that duplicates were inserted meaning multiple ajax requests were posted. I will look into this.
Re-opening because I still occasionally see this in Safari. But, low priority to fix for now.
