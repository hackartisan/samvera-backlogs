Location information in DPUL (and figgy)
Holding location information isn't displaying properly in figgy, and isn't displaying at all in DPUL.  Example from one object (Sketches for Sonata, Opus 106) DPUL display: MICROFILM 2035 MICROFILM 2563 30.15 Electronic Resource figgy display: RCPQK MICROFILM 2035 RCPQK MICROFILM 2563 RCPQK 30.15 RCPQK Electronic Resource SVL MICROFILM 2035 SVL MICROFILM 2563 SVL 30.15 SVL Electronic Resource WHS MICROFILM 2035 WHS MICROFILM 2563 WHS 30.15 WHS Electronic Resource ELF1 MICROFILM 2035 ELF1 MICROFILM 2563 ELF1 30.15 ELF1 Electronic Resource We should not be displaying ELF* locations at all, since this is the reference to the digital object we are already looking at.  What happened with this object is that we have the digital object (which we don't want to display holdings for), 2 microfilmed copies, and the original manuscript.  The locations have been disconnected from the specific call number to which they refer and each call number gets replicated with each location.
 This seems like it should be fixed but we're not sure how important it is.
