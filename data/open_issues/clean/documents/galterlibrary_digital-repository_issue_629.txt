In item record make subjects (LoC and MeSH) hyperlinked (similar to keywords)
We noticed that in item records, there are some fields that are hyper linked. When you click on the keyword, it becomes a search term and pulls up other records with that keyword. We are wondering if this same thing can be done for the Subject MeSH or Subject Library of Congress fields.
