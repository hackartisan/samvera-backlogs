CSB should display any cached EPUB
...not just a monograph's representative EPUB. Setting something to a representative IMO is just about promoting it in the parent's UI, tabs etc. (and interconnecting the EPUB and WebGL reps for Gabii). It should not restrict the use of a route or viewer. CSB is our EPUB viewer and should show any EPUB in the system for various reasons:  development, editing while looking at several EPUB versions in CSB unimpeded right now a handle that is assigned using the EPUB route will only work for the monograph EPUB rep. Change the rep, break the handle at some point we might want more than one EPUB in a monograph and if we continue down an inflexible road with the viewer that will become harder we might redesign the show/edit pages to use it properly at some point etc, or redirect all to CSB view
