Collections Note should not be multi-valued
According to Metadata spreadsheet on Sakai, this one should be single-valued (not multi-valued).
I modified the Collection model, but I need to write a rake task to convert current multi-value notes to single-value.
I made this change to the `feature/41/start-rspec-testing` branch (not ideal), but it's only complete.  Once this issue is complete with a clean up rake task, then you can merge that branch to master.  A potential rake task might look like this:   ``` # Run using: bundle exec rake vdc:convert_note_to_single_value:convert  namespace :vdc do   namespace :convert_note_to_single_value do      desc "Convert Vdc::Resource note properties to be single value. (Example: [] to '')"      task convert: :environment do       vdc_resources = Vdc::Resource.all       vdc_resources.each do |r|         if !r.note.nil?           if r.note.count > 0             r.note = r.note.first           else             r.note = ""           end           r.save         end       end     end   end end ```  I ran out of time to test it out.
Note: Maybe this is okay as multi-value? May need to be discussed later.
