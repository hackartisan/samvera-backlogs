Ingest "Prosody (M. Martin)" (pudl0122 (dh))
Note: No MODS/METS but could proabably be batch-ingested. Files:  Ingest: 2476633.mets 2507476.mets 2990729.mets

There's totally structure in these, may have to look again and see if there's a METS file.
 Can you look at this?
These were done for a DH project but never added to pudl. As far as I know they could be ingested by the studios just like a new project. I suspect/assume that the images are already organized by bibid.
 Even though these appear to have METS?
Only a few do. I think we stopped making them when we realized they weren't going into PUDL
 Okay. Three have METS. There's a total of seven on the Isilon. Are you saying we should disregard the structure for those three and just ingest these as if they're new items?
Interesting...it looks like the structure the's there is just enough to make them renderable as MVWs in the PUDL. If that structure is useful, I can compile these, otherwise I don't think there's anything there to carry forward. Let me know.
 I think it'd be nice to compile those. The structure looks pretty good to me on the first one.
I've ingested the three METS files which were able to be generated. There are four more folders in the `pudl0122` directory, but some have structure I don't know how to deal with. IE, `2502701` has sub-folders `18th_318` and `18th_320` which each have volume subfolders underneath them. Pinged  on slack to ask.
