Make search result visibility configurable on the model
Method to control model visibility in the search results is starting to get unwieldy. I wonder it makes sense to move that configuration to the individual model.

Not sure there is a good (performant) way to do this.
We could make it dynamic code, but that kind of thing fails without eager loading. :(
