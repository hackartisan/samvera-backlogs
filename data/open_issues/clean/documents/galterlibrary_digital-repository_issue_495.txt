Sufia 7.x upgrade
This will be a master ticket listing major changes made to Sufia 6.x that we will need to port. We can then track those in separate tickets.   Migrate Sufia 6.x repository objects  Migrate Sufia 6.x database  Apply NM branding  Create deployment scripts  Enable Google Analytics and New Relic  Add all the custom metadata fields and their descriptions including private notes (only visible to owners/admins), disable generic subjects  Load all the controlled subject vocabularies and associate with custom fields  Integrate with LDAP for authentication and users' attribute pre-population and group assignment  Integrate Shibboleth sign-in/sign-out  Create editor and admin roles and  Integrate custom creator/contributor autocompletion from ldap  Vivo integration  Port the IIIF presentation manifest json generation and make cancancan authorized and work with Solr  Integrate the RIIIF gem, make cancancan authorized, work with Solr and fix cache problems  Integrate IIIF pager/viewer with Works  Fix cache problems for downloads and versioned thumbnails  Institutional collections/works and permission inheritance  Hierarchical collections?  EZID integration  Enable catalog, include collections in the list and implements various admin abilities  Create collection/works index? This might or might not be superseded with Admin Sets.  Roles and users management in the Admin area  Resque or other tool integration for ActiveJobs  Figure out how to not show GVB (and other) pages in the catalog  Integrate 'combined file' functionality for multi-page works  Limit upload to specific file extensions and sizes, fix known bugs  Integrate cloud-based uploads, limit file types and sizes  Add content pages such as News, Agreement and Terms  Adjust tag-cloud to use all subjects and keywords  Add full-text extraction, limited by size  Port derivatives creation fixes and time limits on shell-based jobs
as far as I can see hierarchical collections will need to be supported. I'm sure the list will grow longer :stuck_out_tongue: 
There are a lot of miscellaneous small things that I skipped. I will try really really hard to work with upstream on some of the fixes now that we'll be working on the current code base. If we go with Sufia 7 that is.
