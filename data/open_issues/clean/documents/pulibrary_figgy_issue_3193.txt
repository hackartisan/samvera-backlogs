Audit Log: Figgy should log NetIDs when making changes
We've recently noticed records without depositor populated, and seen edits where we wondered who made them. Some ideas for possible ways to address this:  Always set depositor when creating records, resorting to the first admin user if none is supplied on the command line (but when there is a logged-in user, we should always have it) Add a last modified by field and update any time a change is made Add an event with a depositor field any time a change is made
I'm not sure "first admin user" is really informative; assuming that's an actual person they may not really have anything to do with a given deposit. Could we have some kind of "system" user or something?
I'd be fine with creating a system user of some kind as a last resort in cases where we are loading records on the command-line.
We'd like to store the changes that were made by a ChangeSet, if possible. However, doing so will probably require Valkyrie to add support for `Hash`.
