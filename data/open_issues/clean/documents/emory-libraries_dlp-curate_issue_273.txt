Bulk ingest method for Curate
Story As a Library Staff Depositor, I want to create objects/metadata in bulk through a spreadsheet or other means, so that I can ingest related objects more quickly and reduce redundant data entry Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes This epic describes an enhanced bulk-ingest process that will be developed for Phase 1 Migrations, with a goal of re-usability and extension to future migrations. Emory libraries staff depositors will need a customized bulk-ingest method to create complex objects supporting our Archival Information Package structure. Links to Additional Information Curate Generic Work: SIP Mapping Template Data Sources for Phase 1 Migrations DAMS metadata mapping (images) Alma/MARC metadata mapping (books) Pull-list mapping (books) Checklist   Bulk-ingest may be initiated and monitored through a user interface within Curate  TBD requirements for logging/error reporting?  Bulk ingest will assign or inherit appropriate Depositor and Manager role permissions from the Collection it is deposited into  Bulk-ingest method creates multiple objects in batch according to standardized, user-supplied pull-lists  Bulk-ingest method supports both flat and nested work structures  Bulk-ingest method assigns objects to a specified collection in Curate  Bulk-ingest method maps files to the Curate generic work model, assigning their appropriate FileSet context and PCDM use according to supplied structural metadata  Bulk-ingest method extracts metadata from one or more input sources as specified in the SIP mappings for each collection, including spreadsheets and Alma records  Bulk ingest method extracts, maps, and stores selected metadata as RDF properties in the Curate generic work model as specified in the DAMS, Alma, and pull-list metadata mappings  Bulk-ingest method may also extract and store metadata as part of an XML Preservation Log from one or more sources as specified in the SIP mappings for each collection  TBD Bulk-ingest method integrates with/interoperates with with a file transfer process  TBD Bulk-ingest method integrates with/interoperates with fixity checking for uploaded files  Bulk-ingest method integrates with Curate's preservation events and logging  Given/When/Then  Given (some context) and (some other optional context) When (some action is carried out) Then (a set of observable consequences should occur)
