Mark a bag's validation status
Related to #597 Validating bags could happen multiple times for a given process. Because this is a time-consuming process, we could indicate if a bag is valid or not and prevent a second validation from being run. A small json file could be stored in the root of the bag, as a hidden file, such as .status: valid: "true", last_validated: "2018-07-12T21:16:21-04:00"  Import::Bag can parse the values and bypass running a full validation check, if a previous step has already validated the bag.
The status file, or whichever file is used to track the bag's status, will not be added to the files in the bag and tracked. The extracted bag is generally considered disposable, so the file is only present to help manage the bag until it's deleted after all the files in it have been ingested.
