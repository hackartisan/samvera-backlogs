Evaluate FITS v1.2.2 characterization behavior
We are currently on fits v0.6.1 and have used as high as 0.8.3. I've temporarily upgraded the qa environment to fits v1.2.2 to see what issues we may face for a potential upgrade. After looking at several sample files, it seems that characterization may be working well, except that not all EXIF details are being processed. Below is a list of scholarsphere file links. The upper link is the original file characterized by v0.6.3. The lower link is current scholarsphere qa, characterized by v1.2.2. Please evaluate and determine whether a upgrade is desirable at this time. Thanks! JPG   JPG   JPG   DOCX   XLSX   XLSX   PDF   PDF   PDF   PDF   PDF   PPTX   PDF   PPTX
