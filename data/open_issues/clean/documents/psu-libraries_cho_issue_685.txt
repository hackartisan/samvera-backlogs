Make stored text downloadable/exportable
Any text that is either extracted or OCR and then extracted by CHO and stored should be downloadable by users in the GUI and added as a new file in the appropriate fileset when exported to a bag. Text that is extracted (or OCR'ed and then extracted) by CHO is not stored as a file, but stored as a property, so these files need to be generated on the fly. Done looks like:  text file appears as part of fileset on fileset show page, text file generated on the fly when download actuated by user through GUI bag exports include a text file in the relevant fileset  Related: #652, #654
#699 partially accomplishes this by creating the file and adding to the fileset. Other tickets should cover the other aspects. This ticket will likely be achieved when 1.x is ready.
