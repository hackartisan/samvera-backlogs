Replace schema_fields.yml with houndstooth?
 discovered  which is a community model for modeling metadata requirements that could replace our schema_fields.yml or even the entire data dictionary. with a community-based approach. Can be round-tripped to CSV for easy maintenance by metadata managers and then back to YML for the app. We should consider this.
Would solve some other tickets, like controlling faceting in the data dictionary and hiding fields from public users.  Potential problems?   * Indicating required fields   * Wiring in work-type schemas   * Wiring in dry transactions   * Field mappings for serializations (export options as DC, VRA, etc.; OAI feed)   Related question: Do or will we need a metadata application profile when we are in production? In my mind, that's basically a human-readable version of this same sort of thing, with examples. But, that interpretation could be wrong and this type of profile may not be consistent with our work-type approach.
