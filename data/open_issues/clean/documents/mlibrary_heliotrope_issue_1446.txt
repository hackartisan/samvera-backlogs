Investigate/build support for separate text file
As a publisher, I may provide a separate text file that is more accessible than the original file. E.g. I provide PDFs that are made up of page scans and bundled into a PDF that cannot be made accessible. The generated OCR derived from the PDF is not accessible. I need to be able to upload a separate, cleaned up/rekeyed and accessible text file to the platform.    This file would be associated with the original PDF file (not replacing it).    This file would be downloadable.   Questions    Need to determine if the download button should say something different than Download OCR Text.    Need to determine if the disclaimer message would appear (see ticket #1429).    Is it possible to include this text in the PDF that could then be part of the auto-generated OCR text?   For Turner, we need to get the rekeyed or better OCR-generated (through Prime OCR) file.
We are waiting to get the rekeyed text file. The ability to replace the Extracted File text file should be ready(ish).
