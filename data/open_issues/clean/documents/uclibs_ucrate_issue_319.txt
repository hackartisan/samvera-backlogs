I'm noticing that on develop we have both `rights statement` field and `license` field. Rights statement is redundant, no? Was supposed to be overriden by license maybe?   <img width="688" alt="screen shot 2018-07-31 at 3 41 06 pm" src=""> 
 do we need to draft some language for this? 
 Yes, we do.  I'll look into it.  Might need to run it by the POs.  Hyrax has this field, but they don't provide contextual help text for it.  I'm marking this blocked until we develop text.
We don't have a rights statement anymore
