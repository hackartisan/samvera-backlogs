Setup Email on server
Research & configure our application on how to send and receive emails from our application. This includes, if a user sends an email via the contact form or if we need to send out email regarding embargoes or anything else, what needs to be done.
 should we close this issue or should we keep it open for us to remember to configure emails in our servers. I am leaning towards closing this issue. 
well we still need to decide to recieves the mail and what the mail should say, but we can close this and come back if needed
