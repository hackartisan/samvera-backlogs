If a derivative fails to generate, it should throw an error.
Right now it just continued silently, which made the job not retry.
To replicate: break ImageMagick and try to generate derivatives.
I could not find a way to disable this on the CircleCI environment (uninstalling ImageMagick using Homebrew on my local development environment *did* trigger the failures needed to reproduce this), hence I am going to proceed with testing for this by just raising errors within the context of RSpec tests.
I'm uncertain if retriggering the job explicitly in this manner would be acceptable: 
 hm. it seems like the ticket is asking for the error to make it all the way out so that sidekiq will re-run the job. Is there something up the stack that is stifling the error?
For my local environment, `MiniMagick::Error: ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick is not installed` is still being propagated up through the stack for `CreateDerivativesJob` (I assume that this is how the job restarts are triggered), I'll look to improve the work on the branch in order to ensure that nothing should be getting stifled.
This seems to be addressed by the changes proposed in  with the understanding that this is just a different message for `MiniMagick::Error`.  I will proceed by adding this as an additional test case and closing
