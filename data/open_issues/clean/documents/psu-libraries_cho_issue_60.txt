show multiple relationships for an object
As a researcher, I would like to know whether a digitized object I am reviewing is part of a larger collection/grouping so that I can seek and identify possibly related items. Ben G.
There is a need to differentiate between home collection and display collection. Also that we should have a tree for the home collection. Display collection should just be a list.
Background: 
What does done look like: I can click links that take me to the different collections that this work belongs to. I can do this from multiple places, such as the show page and the search results.
