Find and Replace
As a metadata specialist, I would like to search the entire repository for a specific metadata value, so that I can identify all fields (across collections) where the value exists and mass replace it. Additional user story from Henry P.: As a quality control worker, I want a global find-and-replace with lots of specific options (e.g. limit to “collection,” to field, to try one as a test before doing the global, etc.), so that data quality can be maintained quickly and safely. Additional user story from Jeff E.: As a metadata specialist I need to be able to globally edit metadata across collections using both string replacement and regular expressions so that I can make large numbers of changes without having to touch individual records and to ensure consistency across the database. Additional user stories from Linda B: As a metadata manager, I need to be able to find and replace values in selected fields, for a selection of records (e.g., collection, or type), so I can change them quickly and consistently. As a metadata manager, I need to be able to find and replace values in all fields, for a selection of records (e.g., collection, or type), so I can change them quickly and consistently. As a metadata manager, I need to be able to overwrite values in selected fields, for a selection of records (e.g., collection, or type), so I can change them quickly and consistently. As a metadata manager, I'd like to be able to preview find-and-replace edits before finalizing the change, so I can avoid unexpected matches. Acceptance criteria: Able to scope find/replace functions to a single collection, all collections, or a selection of content. (Admin sets)
