Creating single-use links as an admin
Given that I am logged in as an admin And I'm viewing a file set show page for another user When I click on Create Single-Use Link Then I should see a single-use link created And I should not be redirected to the home page Note: maybe this is the right behavior and we should just hide the button?
We should hide the button unless the person has true edit access
