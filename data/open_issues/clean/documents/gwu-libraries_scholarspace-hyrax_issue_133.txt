Difficult for users to find a way to access the PDF for items
On item view page and file view pages on standard laptop screens, there are no links to the PDF "above the fold". Not tested with non-PDF items. As a user, I would expect the following things to be links to the actual PDF: Item view page (e.g.,  Doesn't link as expected  Thumbnail at top of page (not a link) Thumbnail at bottom of page (links to the file view page) Title at bottom of page (links to the file view page)  Does link as expected  "Download PDF" link below the thumbnail  File view page  (e.g.,  Doesn't link as expected  Title at the top of the page (not a link) Thumbnail at the top of the page (not a link)  Does link as expected  "Download PDF" button below thumbnail
