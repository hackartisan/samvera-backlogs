Mgmt: Research the way name type attributes are handled in RDF
As a metadata librarian, I am experienced in managing controlled values and I am used to categorizing proper names into "personal names" and "corporate names". I need to learn more about the way this information is recorded in RDF. Acceptance Criteria   Reviewed draft MODS to RDF document to determine a solution (document findings here and  or on Confluences)  Contacted peer metadata librarians via Samvera slack for further guidance if needed  Hosted a Samvera Teach and Learn meeting (or other mini-team meeting) with one or more folks from DCE and interested UCLAers about the topic
