Unexpected symbols in file name
The file name for the following resource shows unexpected symbols  The original text is: L'éléphant géant Maybe the apostrophe and diacritics are the culprits?
Similar issue occurs with L'école: 
  could you give me you thoughts on this?
This looks as a know Hyrax bug in series 2.x - see this [upstream hyrax issue]( Here are our options: 1. **Active** - Add this to our future NCELP sprint. Fix it and contribute change upstream to Hyrax code base. 2. **Easy** - Wait for somebody else fixing this and apply changes to our Hyrax once this is available. 3. **Interim work around**  - Use a file edit option and re-type title with correct accents. This is post upload action and will increase a burden on the admin site. 
See my comments on GH issue. BTW, I have corrected file name on this file object so it shows ok now.

Thanks for this. We'll use the work around for now and I'll check with Emma how important this is to fix.
