Provide method for embedding media player from Kaltura
Descriptive summary Media collections now in the Digital Resource Commons, and future collections, are likely to want to link to streaming versions in Kaltura.  Rather than, or in addition to, a simple URL to a work in Kaltura, a worthy enhancement would be to use the embed code provided by Kaltura to embed the video player, with closed captioning, in Scholar@UC. Here is a sample work available today on our dev server:    Here is the streaming equivalent (with closed captioning) in Kaltura:    Here is the embed code Kaltura generates for this work:  <iframe id="kmsembed-1_9a2zbmfd" width="400" height="285" src="" class="kmsembed" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozAllowFullScreen allow="autoplay *; fullscreen *; encrypted-media *" frameborder="0" title="Kaltura Player"></iframe>  Note - This is a public work in Kaltura, but sharing option, with ability to display the embed code, does not display until I login (and I have edit rights to the work).  Check with  if there is a way to retrieve the embed code for public works without authenticating to Kaltura.
Although the embed code in an iframe that Kaltura provides seems one place to start, if there are other options that retain the closed captioning, please explore.
