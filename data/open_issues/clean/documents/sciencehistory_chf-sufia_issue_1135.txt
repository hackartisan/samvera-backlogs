Promoting file to independent (non-child) work
Desired functionality related to #1024: Scenario: A file set consisting of multiple views of an instrument are ingested as a single work. During cataloging, it is discovered that one of the photographs actually depicts a different instrument (for example, see work g732d985s). Accordingly, cataloger wants to promote individual file to a separate work, as opposed to deleting file and re-uploading as a new work. Functionality in development as of 7/23/2018 for promoting a file to a child work does offer a two-step work-around:  Cataloger promotes an individual file to a child work. Cataloger deletes relationship to child in record for what becomes the parent work when the file is promoted.  After the functionality for promoting a file to a child work is implemented, we should revisit the need for functionality to promote an individual file to a separate work, specifically are there enough use cases to warrant implementing this as a separate feature or is the work-around described above sufficient to meet our needs.
Thank you for describing this so concisely. A developer's dream.
