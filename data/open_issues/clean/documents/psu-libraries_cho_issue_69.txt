support for mime types
As a metadata specialist, I would like files to receive characterization upon ingest, with the resulting data stored as PREMIS, So that I can search for content based on MIME-TYPE for digital preservation actions. Child of #637
This doesn't stored as PREMIS for MVP.
Extract mime type from fits output and update property.  Blocked #637
