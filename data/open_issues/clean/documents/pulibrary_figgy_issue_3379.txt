PDF not generating Arabic script correctly
I got some user feedback indirectly (copied below).  I haven't verified it myself but I have responded to the user that we are looking into it. --Joyce Brief Description: error in arabic script titles in autogenerated pdfs of digitized mss Comment: The autogenerated cover sheet for the pdf of a ms that I downloaded renders the Arabic script title with unconnected words (Arabic is never written in this way, and it is basically unreadable). Not sure if this is a problem you have identified already, but I think it would be important to fix it. I can send a picture of the coversheet if you’d like, but I can’t attach anything in the online formula I am using to send this. Best, Paul Babinski
 Thanks for making the ticket.  The PDF cover page generator has some code to connect Arabic letters, but it may not be working correctly.  But I'm not sure if it's failing everywhere, or only for certain items.  Could you provide an example of connected and unconnected Arabic text, to make it easier to identify whether it's working or not?
I wonder if the problem is when we check whether the resource language is Arabic:   Maybe some items don't have Arabic listed first, or the remote metadata isn't loaded, and so it isn't passing this test and connecting the Arabic letters?  AFAICT, connecting letters on non-Arabic text has no effect, so I think we may want to just remove the language check.

Moving this issue to Figgy.
 I can review the Arabic, if needed. Just let me know.
