UI Evaluation: "Add cloud files" process
The ui for the Add cloud files process may be misleading to a significant number of users. Our resident ui expert may want to weigh in. Adding two sets of files through use of the Add cloud files button from within the same work produces the following error: "Not Found - This item is not available" 2017-06-01 14:22:00 -0400 (22538) Rendering 404 page due to exception: #<ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound: Couldn't find Sufia::UploadedFile with 'id'={ssh-key-string}/download> - ["/opt/heracles/deploy/scholarsphere/shared/bundle/ruby/2.3.0/gems/activerecord-4.2.7.1/lib/active_record/relation/finder_methods.rb:324:in `raise_record_not_found_exception!'" To Reproduce: 0. From the /concern/generic_works/new page,  Fill out all necessary metadata Select the Files tab Click Add cloud files Choose the box (or dropbox) source option Select a file Hit Submit Click Add cloud files Choose the dropbox (or box) source option Select a file Hit Submit Check I have read and agree to the deposit agreement Click Save.  Will users understand that when needing to upload from multiple sources that they only need to change the source in the dialog box and not hit submit and add a new set of cloud files from a different provider? If so, feel free to mark as wontfix.
