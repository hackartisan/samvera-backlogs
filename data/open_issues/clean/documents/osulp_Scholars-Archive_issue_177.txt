Parse a delimited string into input form fields
[steve's updated description] DPU staff often are given lists of names (authors, etc.) that they need to ingest into the repository using the ingest form. Not infrequently, that list of names is very long (260 authors is the current record i think) and it would be helpful to not have to input them individually. If the user inputs a string that is delimited (e.g. by a semicolon) it would be great if the ingest form could read those elements into individual form fields. For example: smith, john; jones, davey; williams, william would parse out to smith, john jones, davey williams, william
