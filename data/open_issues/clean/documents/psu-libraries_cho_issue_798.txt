Implement Collection Publishing Workflow
As a curator, I don't want my collection published until I say it's ready and I need to be able to authorize users to work on the collection until it's published, So that it can be prepared behind the scenes and published when I think it's ready. Collections that are unpublished are the same as those with access_rights of Restricted to Group, the group being users assigned a role for this collection, see #684. Published/unpublished is a different lever than access_rights. It is a state where the entire collection is visible or not, a workflow step. Separating this from access_rights helps to prevent overwriting specific resource-level access rights when having to toggle the entire collection on/off for whatever reason. [Updated by NT, 2019-06-05] Set default options for workflow to "publish immediately" and visibility to "public." This will avoid errors when creating new collections.
