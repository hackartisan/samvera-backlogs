Catalog Show View paging implementation is fragile
 and I have noticed that the paging widget breaks in Show Views in several contexts.  When using multiple windows or tabs to search ddr-public, the total counts for each are initially correct. However, once you start using the previous and next buttons the total count will change to whichever search result was loaded more recently, regardless of the actual context of the current tab or window. When clicking through to a Collection from an Item Show View the Collection Show View displays the total count and current page from the Item Show View. This bug also appears when using the "Matching Collections" results (in the collections-results branch). The Collections Show View will display paging information with the correct result number for the Collection, but it will use the total results number from the full result set from the Index View.  In all of these cases, the Previous/Next buttons also behave unexpectedly. This is most strange in the first case where the results from one window will display in the other once you start using paging.
