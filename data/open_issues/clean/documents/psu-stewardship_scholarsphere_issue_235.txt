Can't refresh My Collections, Highlights or Shared with different parameters
From My Collections, My Highlights, or Files Shared with Me, changing "Sort By" or "Show per page" parameters, clicking "Refresh" takes you to My Files instead with the parameters are applied, instead of remaining on the collections tab.
Reconfirmed this issue is still present.
