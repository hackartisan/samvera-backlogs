RSS feed for new SA?
Is there an RSS feed for the new IR? Can it be set up for different collections or presence of metadata?  from Mike Boock
There is for search results.  RSS:  Atom:   Atom Feed for 'Master's Thesis' Resource Type:   RSS doesn't look very useful as it is right now. The Atom feed has more metadata and updated dates.  To get a different specific results feed, on a Results page, right click, select 'View page source' or equivalent, then search/look for RSS or Atom to get the exact feed URL.
 did someone ask for a feed or was this just curiosity?
   This was from Mike Boock notes -- all I have is what's already on the ticket.
I think this can be closed. There are at least a couple communities that auto-populate web pages with SA content/results. Here's an example of one that uses an old feed URL:   I'll look for others and let them all know that they need to change their URLs.
