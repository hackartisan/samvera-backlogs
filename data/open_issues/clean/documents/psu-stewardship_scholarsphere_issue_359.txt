Work on making scholarsphere more compliant with the google scholar API
Contact Google and see what they suggest Strategy for required fields going forward Strategy for fixing currently existing records to be compliant.
Here is some information on indexing:   Here is a list of the files that are currently in google scholar for ScholarSphere:    From what I can see google scholar is getting the metadata from the documents instead of our metadata tags.   vs   The title in google scholar is from the paper instead of from the ScholarSphere page. 
After some research and fiddling, reading some publications on this I have found a few things, but still not sure what it means. 1. As pointed out, only 6 of our records are in Google scholar. I don't think any of them have the correct meta tags, so they are probably getting the info from the text. 2. I found a bunch of records that do have the correct meta tags but are not getting indexed. 3. The existing literature is all on DSpace repos, which Google Scholar seems to support.     1. When I look at their content, they are using Modified Dublin Core tags. (    2. I looked at a 4 other Hydra repos (Duke, Stanford and Yale, Notre Dame) and none of their content is indexed I think. Some of them didn't have any tags. (Notre DAme). Some I wasn't able to find a repository of scholarly articles.     3. Not sure if this is hydra but  from Oregon STate works. They seem to have a DSpace IR and a Hydra one that is not used so much for scholarly articles.  I'm not quite sure what is going on but I'm suspecting googles documentation isn't quite right. Perhaps we need to use the DSpace style tags? 
I went to the meeting with Alberta at Hydra Connect.  They had multiple choices for what was fixing their google scholar integration.   One items was having the download below the file page:   One item was having the sitemap in the robots.txt   One item was having more metadata for google scholar (do not have a commit for that yet)  Will contact to see if I can get the slides. 
I was working on updating based on alberta and noticed that the new etda site is being indexed nicely by google scholar.    That has 10K of the 12K results.  The current ETDA version went live in May and some of the newer papers have been indexed.    Here is example metadata   ``` <meta name="citation_title" content=" A Study of Turkish Kindergarten Teachersâ€™ Attitudes Toward Two Instructional Models: Direct Instruction and  Child-Initiated Instruction   "> <meta name="citation_author" content="Ulker, Riza "> <meta name="citation_publication_date" content="2006-10-09T08:00:00Z"> <meta name="citation_pdf_url" content=""> ``` 
At this point the honors site has not gotten any files indexed.
  Will try contacting them again.
