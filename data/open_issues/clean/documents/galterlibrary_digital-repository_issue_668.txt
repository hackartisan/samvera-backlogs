Accessing /stats is throwing errors
From NewRelic:  {"errors"=>[{"domain"=>"global", "reason"=>"rateLimitExceeded", "message"=>"Quota Error: Number of recent failed reporting API requests is too high, please implement exponential back off.\nSee developer documentation for details at "}], "code"=>403, "message"=>"Quota Error: Number of recent failed reporting API requests is too high, please implement exponential back off.\nSee developer documentation for details at "}: {"error":{"errors":[{"domain":"global","reason":"rateLimitExceeded","message":"Quota Error: Number of recent failed reporting API requests is too high, please implement exponential back off.\nSee developer documentation for details at "}],"code":403,"message":"Quota Error: Number of recent failed reporting API requests is too high, please implement exponential back off.\nSee developer documentation for details at "}}  This is mostly triggered by bots. We should at least disallow /stats in our robots.txt.
We implemented throttling in #672 and should be enough to handle `/stats` path. Will reopen, and use a custom throttle rule for this path if NewRelic still reports issues with it. 
These errors are back. Current throttle rules may not be enough, and we may need to make specific rule for this path.   Also, can look to see if we already use `userIP` or `quotaUser` parameters.
