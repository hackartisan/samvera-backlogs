User-initiated Contact with Libraries
As a remote researcher, I would like to contact University Libraries, So that I can ask a question. Acceptance Criteria: system issues and content questions start in the same spot. User has an initial question if the problem is about the system or related to content. If system question, feedback goes to product owner. If a content question, feedback goes to collection curator. (Curator name/contact will be stored with collection-level metadata, would need to lookup based on collection user is actively using at the time.) User should see one option to initiate contact, not multiple options. Needs to be able to initiate contact to the appropriate person (context per collection) from wherever they are in CHO. Dependent on #161
Combines/refines #112 #141 #196 which have been closed.
Grab metadata from the page being viewed at the time to be able to have the proper person contacted based on the collection that is viewed. We will need a way to also enter this data and then essentially send a contact form email to a specific person group, based on the collection.
Systems questions can be routed to super admin user group.  In the event that the administrative collection-level metadata does not include a curator, content questions should also go to super admins, with a note that the collection does not have a designated curator.
