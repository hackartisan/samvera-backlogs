Support for Large Files
As a repository manager, I need CHO to be able to store and preserve very large files, So that audio/visual object may be kept in CHO. Largest file we currently have is 422GB, it is not in CONTENTdm at this time, but stored on Isilon.
Not deliverable to the end user.  Original master, h264 access copy, and a mezzanine copy, which is much more usable in editing software.  Mezzanine would be downloadable by the user (possibly Globus copy).  Look at how Hydra Dam or Avalon points to the file external to Fedora.  The user should be able to view and download the mezzanine file.  If the content needs to be secure it would not be able to be downloaded.   For private items file content would be private, but the metadata would be public.  IIIF is adding support for moving images.  Large derivatives that are not masters could be stored on tape like in hydra-dams 2.  We need to support Ingesting of large files with this ticket.  Mezzanine and access copies are not preservation copies.  We should store all files either in or out of Fedora
While the ability to have large files in CHO is MVP, getting them in via the GUI is not.
