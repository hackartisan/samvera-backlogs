Video files at 700MB also fail to upload with FF: ``` [ 2016-12-14 13:51:26.4519 12416/7f813a64f840 apache2/Hooks.cpp:732 ]: Unexpected error in mod_passenger: An error occurred while receiving HTTP upload data: The timeout specified has expired (70007)   Backtrace:      in 'boost::shared_ptr<Passenger::BufferedUpload> Hooks::receiveRequestBody(request_rec*)' (Hooks.cpp:1190)      in 'int Hooks::handleRequest(request_rec*)' (Hooks.cpp:546) ```
