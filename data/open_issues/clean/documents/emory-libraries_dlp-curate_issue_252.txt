Event - Format Validation
Story As a Library Staff Depositor,Collection Manager or Preservation Curator, I want to use a Validation service and logging for ingested files, so that I can be notified if a file I deposited is potentially corrupted and needs to be replaced Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes Relates to FITS characterization process; logs FITS' format validation outcome as its own event. FITS defines format validation as "Determination of a file's consistency with the requirements of the specification(s) governing the file's format." Links to Additional Information FITS Filestatus section Approved Preservation Events & Workflows Preservation - Metadata Properties Needed Preservation Log - XML Mockup File & FileSet/Technical Metadata List of all Preservation UI Mockups UI Mockup: Preservation Summary - Event Failure Checklist   Run as part of Accession or Ingest workflow  Can be run on demand outside of a workflow  Event outcomes stored in Preservation Log including standard Event metadata  Log FITS validation with the type, "Format validation" (in the future, other types of validation may occur)  If there is a failure, provide either a UI-based notification or an email to the depositor  A failure should not prevent a file from getting deposited  Given/When/Then  Given (some context) and (some other optional context) When (some action is carried out) Then (a set of observable consequences should occur)
