Assign non-Administrator Roles, Groups and Users to Curate Collections
Story As a Repository Administrator, I want to assign system-wide user roles to groups for Administrative Sets and Collections, so that I can assign and manage individual user permissions effectively Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes This epic relates to configuring Curate user accounts for Library Staff, and managing those users in Hyrax permission groups assigned as Participant Roles for each collection. Generally, permission groups/roles are established for each Library and are re-used across the collections. We have also identified one or more repository-wide groups that should have access to all Collections, but users in this group will not need full Administrator-level access. Links to Additional Information Groups and Users worksheet Curate/Hyrax System Roles: best practices Checklist   Identified Library Staff users from the worksheet above have Curate accounts  Identified groups of users are created within Curate  Appropriate groups have been assigned to Participant Roles for each collection (e.g. Viewer, Depositor, and Manager level roles)  Hyrax-default roles/users are removed from each Collection  Permissions structure is compatible with any setup/automation tasks for Curate  Given/When/Then  Given (some context) and (some other optional context) When (some action is carried out) Then (a set of observable consequences should occur)
