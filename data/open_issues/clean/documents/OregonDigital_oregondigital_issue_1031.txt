Need to force https for login page
While we support https for oregondigital, we don't force it for the login page. Thus unless users specifically go to the  url themselves, we are passing credentials in the clear.
Based on some very incomplete testing, it looks like the site does work if a user manually goes to  . Easy fix would is likely to make the entire site https via redirect on the nginx proxy that just redirects all urls to their https equivalent.
 is going to talk to  about getting this on his task list.
