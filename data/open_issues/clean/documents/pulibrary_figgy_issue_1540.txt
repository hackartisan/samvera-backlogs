Do we need lossless jp2s?
Lossless jp2s? Upcoming are some materials that require finer resolution PSNR -> can we calculate? If below 40 re-generate with less compression. If still below, regenerate as lossless. Make sure you’re comparing same color profiles (studio uses sRGB) They’re noticing a difference between TIFF/Figgy jp2 much greater than difference between TIFF/local jp2s. Roel can show some examples. Problem may be in Loris during conversion to PNGs. Studio can try on staging to see if cantaloupe does better. Compare the loris jp2 to the local jp2. discussed at digital studio users meeting 7/19/2018
See #860 for the recipe and further notes.
Copied from #860:  Should we add the ability to select a lossless JP2 recipe, similar to how we allow different PDF quality settings?   says these changes to our existing recipe would be needed for lossless:  ``` For lossless JP2, change rate to: -rate -,2.4,1.48331273,.91673033,.56657224,.35016049,.21641118,.13374944,.08266171  And add: Creversible=yes ```
 says There are a couple of engraving projects from Julie's collection in PUDL that had to be processed in lossless. Even with very mild compression the engraving details got crushed.   Do you know which engravings these were?
