Audio player displays black box on initial page load
The AV player for the Holmes and Hitchcock works displays and opaque, black box when first loading the main work page and the individual child work pages.  I can send screenshots if you need them.  If the user reloads the page, the player displays properly. Jess thinks this was a javascript issue that happened before.
I noticed something important about this bug that I want to record here. The first time we load an AV player in a browser window, it loads successfully. After that, this browser window will fail to load all other AV players (even on different pages) until it is refreshed. If you open a lecture or course in a new tab, it will load successfully.  Given this observation, the cause of this is almost certainly the same as issue #57. The browser window is keeping our players loaded in the background, when you navigate away, and so players from different pages are interfering with one another.
