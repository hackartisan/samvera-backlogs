Extract selected metadata for books/serials from a pull-list spreadsheet
Story As a Library Staff Depositor, I want to provide selected metadata through a spreadsheet for books/serials, so that essential repository-related metadata not contained in the catalog record can be supplied as part of a bulk-ingest process Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes This epics relates to #218 (Extract metadata from Alma/MARC records). Some of the metadata specified in the Curate generic work metadata profile does not exist in Alma records and needs to be supplied through an alternate source. The pull-list file also indicates the objects that need to be created and the accompanying Alma record ID to extract from.
