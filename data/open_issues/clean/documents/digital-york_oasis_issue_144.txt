Upload form: Description text needs to be revised for the three fields that have been changed from drop-down lists to checkbox lists 
Three fields (Age of learners, Proficiency of learners, Context of language use) have been changed from dropdown lists to checkbox lists. This means that some of the description text for these fields is now incorrect. Please amend as follows: Age of learners - please remove "Any format is appropriate. For example an age range, a mean, one specific age, age in years, age in months. The field accepts free text. Hold down Ctrl/Command to select more than one term"  Proficiency of learners - remove "Hold down Ctrl/Command to select more than one term"  Context of language use - remove "Hold down Ctrl/Command to select more than one term"
