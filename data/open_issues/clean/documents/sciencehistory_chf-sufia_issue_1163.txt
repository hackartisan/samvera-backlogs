WIP Download SOLR from a local URL
Amend solr_wrapper so it can download SOLR from a local URL. The URL should be accessible to us (both locally and on Travis) but not to anyone else.
I am pretty sure solr_wrapper already has a feature to download Solr from whatever URL you give it. Although I don't remember how to use it, needs to be investigated.   In our case, we are thinking of one of our S3 buckets. The sticking point may be authentication issues. 
If the solr wrapper config files are run through ERB, it might be as simple as embedding via ERB some code that generates a signed S3 URL on every boot. 
Yes, solr_wrapper can definitely download the code (and the checksum) from arbitrary URLs.
we'd have to consider costs of downloading from S3 every time CI runs.  
> If the solr wrapper config files are run through ERB, it might be as simple as embedding via ERB some code that generates a signed S3 URL on every boot.  They're not -- they use yml for all the paths and urls. There's no opportunity to make changes to the urls at download time .... as solr_wrapper currently stands.
 yml files are often run through ERB first. I believe the solr_wrapper ones might be.   So you can put `<%= ruby_code %>` in the YML, and it is interpreted, and is expected to result in legal YML. So for instance:        some_key: '<%= SomeClass.class_method_that_outputs_a_string %>'  Let's see... yes, solr_wrapper does that convenient thing, so that should work:    Note the `ERB.new` in there.  So if you put the ERB tags `<%= %>` in there, it is run through ERB first, executing what's inside the tags and replacing them with whatever that code outputs, before giving the result to the YAML parser. 
Cool. I did *not* realize this was going on. Never seen this pattern before. Very cool.
