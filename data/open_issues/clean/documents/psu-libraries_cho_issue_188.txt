Work-in-Progress Constantly Saving in Background
As a collection curator, I would like any work-in-progress to be saved in the background, even if as a draft, So that I don't have to constantly re-save my work and so that I don't accidentally loose any work. From Linda B. As a metadata manager, I'd like to allow metadata creators to save incomplete draft descriptions, even if they do not include mandatory fields, so that work in progress may be saved and reviewed. Required fields should only block publishing an item, not saving it.
