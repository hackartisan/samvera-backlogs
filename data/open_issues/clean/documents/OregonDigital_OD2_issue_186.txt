Improve models test coverage
Descriptive summary Models (Document, Generic, Image, Video) have basic tests to check metadata but are not covering validations, indexer, or included behavior. Add additional tests to cover these models.
Also include model specific field coverage, see `spec/models/image_spec.rb` for an example.
