Deleting place entry doesn't bring up a list of entries
Tried to delete Arles - should have brought up a list of entries this place is linked to in the database, but instead, it was deleted. Searched online database to check whether Arles linked to entries or not - it is, to four entries, so should not be deleted if ‘delete’ button hit. Searched for York, York City, because I know it should be linked to many entries, tried to delete, and long list of entries to which attached came up, so that stills works.
Search for 'Arles', the places from the returned results contain an entry like: Place of person status: Arles, Bouches du Rhone, France (archdiocese); **written as** Aralaten'  Need to find out how the 'written as' works, it might be the missing bit in the admin tool (while doing search)
