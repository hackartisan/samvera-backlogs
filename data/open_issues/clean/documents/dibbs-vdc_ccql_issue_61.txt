SQL lock error when uploading lots of files.
I maxed out the number of files to upload. When I save it just spins. As  user I'm not sure what happened, so I just navigated back to my dashboard. At that point, Then when I tried to visit the work, it got an error shown in the screen grab below.  Eventually it did work, so I think the DB was just locked while munching through all the data. Most people run these in background jobs using resque or something like that. Probably that would help. Also maybe SQLite is the problem too. If you are using Postgres in production might as well use that in development too. (just suggestions sorry if I'm being pushy).
Thanks for the suggestions! I think they're good ones. We're currently running everything inline, and it's not set up to run background jobs yet. I think I'd read about limitations using sqlite, which is why most folks move to Postgres or MySQL, but we're not there yet. These may in fact be part of the problem, so it's good to note.
