PDF generation enhancements ala jrock
Look into what jrock did for science history foundation, including an in-browser progress bar and some caching. See if we would benefit from any of these features or implementation details. 
note it seems we also have a use case for bulk pdf generation / download (cdh)
Though I think the bulk approach was to work around slow/failing PDF generation.
 The VAST VAST majority of the time for building PDFs is downloading the derivatives off the image server for each page - something like 1-3 seconds a page. I decreased the quality a little and it looks readable to me, so I think we should still do that, but it doesn't seem to mean a significantly faster creation time.  So it looks like we need to pre-generate PDFs? It'd be a lot of disk space. Or we can go back to Plum's method of generating the first time it's requested?
Is this ticket relevant now that we are caching PDFs like we did in Plum?
