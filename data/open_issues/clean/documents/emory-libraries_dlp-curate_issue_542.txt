Create Administrative Objects for each Collection in Phase 1
In order to store and manage selected collection-level information and files, we will create private administrative/staff-only objects in the repository to attach supplemental preservation files for each collection. This approach also simplifies the need to split legacy metadata exports into individual records to assign at the per-object level.   Administrative object follows consistent naming pattern so they are easy to distinguish from other content objects  DCSC approval document attached  Copyright review documentation attached if applicable  Donor agreement documentation attached if applicable  Export of full collection metadata attached if applicable (e.g. DAMS export)  Administrative object is restricted at the steward's discretion so that it will not be visible in the Lux application
