Spontaneous embargo reason but no embargo
Descriptive summary A grad student emailed that she noticed an embargo reason on her deposit even though she had not selected an embargo.  The deposit is currently in grad school review queue: f1881s168 I added and then removed an embargo to see if that would override the settings but it did not. The Embargo reason field is not editable by admin.
I can confirm the lack of active embargo status, but the reason still being there: ``` irb(main):002:0> item.embargo => #<Hydra::AccessControls::Embargo id: "51c417b6-dc33-46f7-81ab-5123d50c7678", visibility_during_embargo: nil, visibility_after_embargo: nil, embargo_release_date: nil, embargo_history: ["An active embargo was deactivated on 2019-06-11.  Its release date was 2020-01-11T00:00:00+00:00.  Visibility during embargo was authenticated and intended visibility after embargo was open"]> irb(main):003:0> item.embargo_reason => "Ongoing Research" ```
I manually removed the embargo reason on f1881s168
