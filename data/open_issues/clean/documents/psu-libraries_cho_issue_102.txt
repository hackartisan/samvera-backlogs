These metadata fields would be permissions based - would appear to admins but not public.
These fields should also be excluded from any OAI-PMH/ResouceSync based harvesting.
Property of a field in the data dictionary. Boolean value indicating that it is hidden or not. Anyone who can edit the resource can see the field in display. Users who cannot view the field should be not able to search on it.
