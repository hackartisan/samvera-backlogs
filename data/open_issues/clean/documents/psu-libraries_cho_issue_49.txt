view front and back of digitized object
As an end user, I need to be able to view the front and the back of two-sided objects (e.g. postcards, trade cards, etc.), So that I can study it as a complete object and see where the side that matched my search fits into the context of the entire object.
Compound objects. Be able to switch between them in the viewer. Front and back of a page for example. Is this different than the Universal Viewer? Separate viewer? Multiple files. Plum does this already. IIIF examples.
