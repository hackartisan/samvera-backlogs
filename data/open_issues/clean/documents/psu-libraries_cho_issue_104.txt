Display Fields vs System Fields: Using Controlled Code when Entering Metadata
As a metadata manager, I'd like to be able to use controlled codes that are translated in the public view, So that I don't have to enter the full value each time E.g. Entering "eng" into a language field results in a value of  in the stored metadata and displayed to the user as "English" in the public view. Related: #19 Linda B
ISO-639 for language codes.  Do we need to use ISO-639-2 or ISO-639-3?
