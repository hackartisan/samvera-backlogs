Read-only Solr queries through admin interface
The ability to run arbitrary read-only queries against the Solr index will be important for current and future metadata remediation projects. This doesn't need to be a fancy UI: just some ability to submit queries and get raw results from the index. I know   has thoughts on how to implement this.  Also related to #1588
We are unable to provide librarians direct access to the Solr core. We would need to provide a layer in the SS admin interface, so that we are not interrupting the development workflow and empowering others to obtain rich reporting.   Notes (core dump): Ask a question and get an answer Dump out JSON For example the 5175 metadata remediation file. Copy the Solr query interface in the admin interface but it is just a GET.  Data harvesting for faceted items explore some tools that help librarians research and explore the data
