Preservation Storage with 2+ copies
Story As a Repository Administrator or Preservation Curator, I want to ensure that 2 or more copies of repository assets are stored in preservation quality storage environments, so that the Libraries minimize risk of data loss and to align with industry best practices Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes For version 1, we will support at least 2 copies through S3 with cross-regional replication. Long term, we will increase our support through 3 copies, with geographic and technological diversity (not all copies stored in AWS). Relates to epic for Replication Event and #254 Ingest Workflow. Links to Additional Information Digital Preservation FRG Storage Recommendations AWS S3 with cross-region replication Checklist   2 copy durable storage in S3 (through regional replication or other means)  Minimum of 5TB will be needed for production for Phase 1 migrations  Additional storage needed for test for Phase 1 migrations  When files are stored in S3, we may record a confirmation as a Replication Event in the Preservation Log  Given/When/Then  Given (some context) and (some other optional context) When (some action is carried out) Then (a set of observable consequences should occur)
