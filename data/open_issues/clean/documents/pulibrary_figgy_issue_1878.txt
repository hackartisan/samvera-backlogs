Research captioning/transcription vendors
UXO can recommend some captioning vendors Maybe digitization vendors can do captioning? Cornell is doing a pilot on in-house captioning with student workers
Don Skemer and Kelly Bolding recommended looking at temi.com (automated but apparently very good) â€” though they are English-only.
General searching, ask on mailing lists, slack channels. We've had trouble getting the list from UXO.
