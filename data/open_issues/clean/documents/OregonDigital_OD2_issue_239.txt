Change or Recover password should not be an option for UO/OSU authenticated users
Descriptive summary On current implementation of authentication, UO and OSU authenticated users are presented with an option to change their password. This should not be an option if a user is authenticated  in these ways, as OD is not responsible/empowered to make password changes in these contexts. Expected behavior UI should not allow these options if the user is logged in via UO or OSU auth.
