Tracking how users access OASIS
  A question for now, to see how much work (if any?) would be involved in the following: Is it possible to record information about how users find OASIS e.g. via other websites, google search, link in an email etc? This is an important question, as we will have partner organisations advertising and linking to the OASIS website, and to specific OASIS summary pages. It will be really useful and important for us to be able to see which links on other websites are the best portals to OASIS. Would we be able to gather this information for individual OASIS summary pages? Or are we only able to gather this information for the general OASIS website? Is this something that is already covered in the Google Analytics tools? If so, is this already implemented for OASIS? This is just a question for now, so that we can understand how much work would be involved in implementing this. Thank you.
