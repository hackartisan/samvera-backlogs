Change "Vocabulary" label when editing a Vocabulary to say "Category", add help text.

We should user test the actual label. Maybe "Parent Vocabulary" would be more helpful.  Also consider adding help text.
I think we should actually change this to work more like MVWs, where you only get that box when you're creating a category, and you don't get it when editing.
