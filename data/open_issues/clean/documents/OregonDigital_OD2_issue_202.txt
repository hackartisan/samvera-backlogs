Solve problem of search results by name as metadata (Kringle, Kris) vs. name as OCRed text (Kris Kringle).
Descriptive summary As a user, I'd like to get results of name searches in a clear way whether I type in "Kris Kringle" or "Kringle, Kris" (understanding not results may be identical, of course) in both system and PDF viewer. Expected behavior Solution may rest in the results at PDF viewer level... but not sure. NEEDS DISCUSSIONS. Related work Karl Onthank is a good example for experiments and discussion. Top result in OD1 for either search format is a photo (which likely has the most metadata.) Seventh result has the most Onthank returns (eleven) once you are in the viewer.... but presents as "No returns" there because the OCRed text recognizes "Karl W. Onthank" or just "Onthank" but not "Karl Onthank" or "Onthank, Karl" Link to related tickets or prior related work here.
