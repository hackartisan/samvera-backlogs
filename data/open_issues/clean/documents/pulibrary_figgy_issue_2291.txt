Use case to create a figgy record for an object with suppressed bib record
Sometimes the studio is asked to photograph something brand new. When they're ready to add it to figgy, the marc record isn't done / published yet for the catalog. So figgy can't pull it from bibdata. Use case came via Beth.
This is why title is optional instead of bibid. What do they need? 
Oh, do they want to save and ingest? That makes sense.
