Citations page insufficient for dissertations/theses
Currently citations (enabled via                scholarspace-hyrax/config/initializers/hyrax.rb                    Line 45       in       43252c6                                                     # config.citations = false                     ) are not sufficiently formatted to correctly cite theses/dissertations (see  or similar page).  Also, our app doesn't currently treat masters theses and dissertations as different resource types, so the correct label might have to be deduced from the degree. If we should decide to be more specific about resource types, this might be a candidate for contributing an enhancement to Hyrax.
