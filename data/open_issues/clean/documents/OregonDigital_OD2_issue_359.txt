Fix behavior of "enter" on ingest form
Descriptive summary Typically the "enter" key submits a form.  In our form, it appears as if it does nothing unless you've uploaded a file... in which case it deletes the upload. Expected behavior "Enter" should attempt to submit the form.  If that's not possible for some reason, we need clear instructions above the form that tell users what to expect.  It should never delete files unless you hit "enter" while your focus is on the delete button. The form may be significantly more accessible if it didn't have so many different pieces.  A more DSpace-style form would be a lot more user-friendly.  Enter basic metadata, submit form, now you have an "upload files" page.  Upload files, submit form, now you have a relationships form (or whatever workflow makes sense).  With a clear indication of what step you're on and what steps are left, this can be significantly easier for keyboard-only users (sighted or not).
Note that I refer to pressing "enter" while in a data field, such as a dropdown, radio, or simple text field.  In text areas, "enter" should add a line break.  On any button or link, enter should activate said button or link.
