Showpage Next/Previous item links needed (a la OD1) whether coming from search results or collection.
Descriptive summary As a researcher, on viewing an item on the showpage, I'll want to go to the next or previous of whatever grouping I've arrived there from - whether search result or collection. (Or latest items, even.) Expected behavior On the showpage, a next and previous (alongside a "3 of 7"-type ticker) would take the user to the next in their grouping ( made up this "grouping" term so feel free to change) - whether it is a grouping from a search, a collection (warning: Items may exist in more than one collection, of course), a latest items, or other. (Can we imagine other showpage uses?) Related work Might come with Blacklight in ways that aren't showing in Nurax vanilla. From , perhaps "Blacklight 'natively' and are part of search results I think. Hyrax may be able to use that, or build in different ones via the updated PCDM/member stuff." #99
  Is this still functionality we want? If yes, need to update wireframes
This is probably an expected feature by most users, so is likely a piece of functionality that we would want to retain.
