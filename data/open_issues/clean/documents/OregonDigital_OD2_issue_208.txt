[3] Add validation to allow oEmbed media or regular media, but not both
Descriptive summary Media added to a work and oEmbed media should not both exist on the same work. Expected behavior Add validation to check that if media is already added to a work, oEmbed is not able to be added. If oEmbed is specified for a work, regular adding of media files is disabled for that work. Related work #207
I think easiest solution would be validation of presence on files and just present an error when saving w/ both present. Removing fields or tabs might be trickier but I'll need to play around in the code to see.
 I've looked over the work creation workflow and if we validate at the work model level, there's no way to know if files were submitted with the work since they attach later. I've tried validating for just oEmbed and no files, but the delayed file processing decides to clobber the validation process and save anyways, leaving us with invalid works. I'm still exploring validating at form submission but rails just isn't cooperating with me right now.  By default, Hyrax doesn't validate file presence anyways. It validates on the front-end that files are submitted with the form and we can do the same to exclusive-or w/ oEmbed media. We wouldn't run any more risk than we already do for form submissions. Our major risk increase comes from ingesting works with a direct-to-backend process, where we can already easily make works w/o files, but works w/ both would also be possible now.
