Display more embargo info for embargoed files
Currently, embargoed files render with:  file name of "File" default "empty" thumbnail "embargoed" label (this is good)  The non-logged-in user has no way to find out when the embargo ends. We might want to utilize the substitute value for file name to display something like "Embargoed until {date}". Also consider a different default thumbnail for embargoed items (for example, showing "Embargoed" versus the default thumbnail that indicates either no file or only a primary file with no thumbail available. Advise deferring any action on this until we have upgraded to Hyrax 2.x, to see what improvements to embargo management/display are in 2.x.   If the above issues remain, consider submitting as Hyrax issues.
