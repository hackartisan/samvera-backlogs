Enhance JavaScript for QA for a better user experience.
Like maybe adding an in progress spinner that lets you know its searching. Also an error or alert suggesting it didnt or it didnt find anything.
We should write some modular JS that adds/extends this functionality to the fields that get the `autocomplete` functionality. It would make it somewhat easier to create a PR for this to the community (rather than overriding the existing autocomplete JS)
