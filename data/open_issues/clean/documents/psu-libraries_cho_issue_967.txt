Move files out of public directory
Currently, all files ingested into CHO are stored, via symlinks, to public/files. This was originally done so that the application would have access to all the files and could render or download them. Now that the downloads controller takes care of getting the correct path to the file, the symlink should be removed. TODO   update application.yml on the server to reflect new storage location   remove files symlink creation and linked directory in deploy.rb   ensure that thumbnails still render  Details  use the downloads controller for thumbnails (potential performance hit) copy or symlink all thumbnails to a separate, public directory use a thumbnails controller?
