Intermittent Redis::CannotConnectError when accessing notifications
I'm getting an intermittent Redis::CannotConnectError when I attempt to access my notifications. This happens intermittently on a shared dev machine, but not on my local dev machine. I attempted one configuration change in config/redis.yml, where I changed the development.host from localhost to be set via the ENV['REDIS_DEV_HOST'] value. development:   host: <%= ENV['REDIS_DEV_HOST'] || 'localhost' %>   port: 6379  However, after changing this, my dashboard starting producing a different redis error (which I didn't capture at the time). I then reverted the development.host back to localhost, and none of the errors resurfaced afterwards. I feel like this error isn't really gone, so I'm documenting it here to refer to later.
