Audio/Video Enhancement for Universal Viewer
Descriptive summary Currently, audio and video files arent set up to run through universal viewer. We would need to do some work on learning more about universal viewer to run the audio and video files through that. There has also been some talks of work being done in hyrax to render different viewers depending on what the format of the file is. This would be a smart mechanism that would make a decision about what to render based on the extension of the file it receives. If we want to use UV, we will have to do some work, but by the time we get here, audio and video might be working by default. We will have to track this and make a decision once we get here. Expected behavior Audio and Video works on the show page of a work with an audio or video file. Related work Audio and video configuration or different viewer based on the file associated with the work.
Check in with Chris Colvard with Indiana University and Avalon to see what direction this is heading and when he expects this work to be folded into Hyrax.
