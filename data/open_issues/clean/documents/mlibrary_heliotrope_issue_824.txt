Abstract out theme stylesheets for each publisher
To enable a publisher to configure its colors and typography via a dashboard we will need to refactor how publisher specific styles are stored. Each publisher should be abstracted out of app/assets/stylesheets/themes.scss to its own include sass stylesheet (ie, _michigan.scss) that gets pulled into app/assets/stylesheets/themes.scss   Move publisher specific styles in themes.scss to self-contained sass include file  Modify themes.scss to include each publisher specific file  Test to ensure no CSS is broken with this configuration
