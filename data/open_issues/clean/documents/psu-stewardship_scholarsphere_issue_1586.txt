Link to README Guide
When a dataset has no README, the work's page includes a suggestion to add one:  How about adding a README file? ...  We should include a link to our new README guide. I suggest changing the text as follows:  How about adding a README file? Please see our guide for documenting your dataset with a README file
Update the text to be a little more generic for multiple resource types and leave the link for the guide. Leave the resource types as they are now. For example, "your work"
