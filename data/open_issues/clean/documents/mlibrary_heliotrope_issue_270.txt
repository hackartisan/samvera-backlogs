Work out inheritance behavior for monograph embargo/scheduled pub date
When that pre-scheduled pub date (presumably using CC's embargo feature) occurs, and that monograph becomes 'visible', what happens to the visibility of all of its members (sections and assets)?   Need ability to set separate embergo dates or restrictions on those descendants that aren't overriden every time the state of the monograph changes. AND those descendants need to stay unpublished as long as the parent monograph is unpublished, regardless of their own visibility settings. DRAFT ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:   An asset or section can be flagged to either always inherit its visibility/pub date from the parent monograph, OR to have its own private value assigned.  An asset or section must respect the least permissive visibility of either itself or any of its ancestors.
