Search terms highlighted when viewing work from search results
As a historian performing a search, I would like to know exactly where my search query appears in the work and click directly to it, so that I don't have to download a PDF and perform a search to find the content relevant to my research. When a user clicks on work in search results, the work should load with the first search result loaded and highlighted, not the first ordered fileset. CHO MVP searches the representative file set, not individual files, which are suppressed in search results (#498). This enhancement is to be able to search within all file sets attached to a work. We may want to still suppress file results in the catalog but have a "search this work" feature on the work page -- stakeholders should be consulted on preferences. #156 describes showing a snippet where the terms appear in the work.
