Student/Employee and Student Type context 
OSU has a "Persons" API that can be used to query if a user is a student or employee. I've opened a line of communication in getting the API extended to include if the student is a graduate or undergraduate. The idea here is that we could extend the User model to include a few fields about the user;   api_person_type:string : Employee or Student  api_student_type:string : Null, Undergraduate, or Graduate  api_person_updated_at:datetime : The previous datetime that the API was queried for the persons details  Some thoughts around throttling the frequency we use the API to query these details.  When a user logs in, evaluate if a configurable period of time has elapsed and if the API should be queried to update the status of the person. Maybe this configuration should be a couple months or so? Depending on the previous evaluation, query the API and update the Users record.
