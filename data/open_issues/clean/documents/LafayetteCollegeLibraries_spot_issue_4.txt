non single-pdf items from ldr.lafayette
initial passes at the LDR collection migration were made with the assumption of expecting a single pdf for each work. when this isn't the case, the exceptions will be tracked here to aid in the creation of other content-types (or expansion of the Document type).    filename what's up?     38.zip contains multiple .tiff files (exports from Lewis Postcards collection)   422.zip contains video file (.vob)   444.zip contains slides from presentation (multiple pdf derivatives)   677.zip test item (can likely be skipped)   1149.zip article and supplement   1712.zip paper + presentation   1713.zip paper + presentation
