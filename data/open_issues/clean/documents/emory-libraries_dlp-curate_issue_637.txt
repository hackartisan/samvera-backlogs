Directory Paths for some Langmuir images incorrect in importer
There are about 500 Langmuir images whose path contains an "OP" or "XOP" directory. These files paths appear to be getting rewritten when checked by the CSV importer: Original path value from CSV ::nasn2dmz.cc.emory.edu:dmfiles:MARBL:Manuscripts:MSS_1218_Langmuir:ARCH:OP:MSS1218_OP1_P0001_ARCH.tif Path as reported by importer pre-check (see original "OP" vs. "OP1" directory below): /mnt/prod_efs/Collections/dmfiles/MARBL/Manuscripts/MSS_1218_Langmuir/ARCH/OP1/MSS1218_OP1_P0001_ARCH.tif  Solomon checked our EFS file system and files do appear to be in the original path noted in the CSV: /mnt/prod_efs/Collections/dmfiles/MARBL/Manuscripts/MSS_1218_Langmuir/ARCH/OP/MSS1218_OP82_P0001_ARCH.tif
