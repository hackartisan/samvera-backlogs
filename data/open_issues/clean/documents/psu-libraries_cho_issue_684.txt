Application User Roles
As a repository manager, I would like to easily be able to grant specific users, specific roles, So that I can facilitate collaborative collection building amongst PSU staff, faculty, and students. To be a production system, CHO needs to have application user roles in addition to public users (#447) and PSU users (#172).  repository manager (repository-wide role)  super admin export metadata and objects as bags (for entire collections and individual or groups of resources, including restricted objects) all features below   metadata manager (repository-wide role)  manage all metadata on all collections, including access rights, collection editors and collection submitter roles manage all metadata on all resources manage OAI and other serialization and syndication settings add and update resources via CSV add and delete resources via GUI export metadata (for entire collections and individual resources, including restricted objects) run reports   collection editor (per-collection role)  manage all metadata on the collection, including access rights and collection submitter role manage all metadata on contained resources add and update resources via CSV add and delete resources via GUI export metadata (for entire collection and individual resources, including restricted objects) run reports   collection submitter (per-collection role)  add resources via GUI add resources via CSV

Todo:  * create collection fields for collection editor, metadata manage, and submitter; use data dictionary #1020 * update Ability.rb to enforce restrictions (#1021)   * collection editor can manage the collection and its works   * collection submitter can only add new works to a collection * fields for adding users will be simple text input fields and later will be built with autocomplete * don't implement metadata manager role yet (repository managers can set collection editors) (#1022 ) * repository manager is the current admin role; ensure they retain the ability to edit the other fields  New application roles not listed here will be implemented in #1019
