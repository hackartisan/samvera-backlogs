Download zip links are displaying for large collections
For large collections and works, zip download links are available when they should not be. The issue is that the presenter has zip_download_path.present? which is returning true even for a pre-zipped resource when it should be checking to see if the path actually exists.
Looks like this was just a config issue. The production application.yml was point to qa zip directory, which did in fact have zips. I've updated the config file in prod and now the links are no longer visible.
