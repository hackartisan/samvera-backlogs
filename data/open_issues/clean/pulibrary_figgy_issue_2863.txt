Questions / potential refactors for BrowseEverything::Parameters
It might be nice to extract methods for just the files and just the directories here:    Related to the above, there's already a selected_files method, which I think gets all selected files and all files within selected directories. It would be nice to have a version that just gets directly-selected files, and of course important to name them clearly.   Why on line 15 does it default to an array but on line 36 to a hash? It seems like we would expect one or the other
