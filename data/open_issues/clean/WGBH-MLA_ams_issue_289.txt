Not all DigitalInstantiations from Batches#show are shown in Assets details page
Background: After ingest, when looking at /batches/[id], some Assets show that they have child DigitalInstantiations which aren't showing up when you go to the details page for the Asset.
This is happening because for reasons unknown, some of the `PhysicalInstantiation` objects are _not_ getting added as `ordered` members of the `Asset` instance.  The result of this is that the `DigitalInstantiation` is missing from the display, because only the `ordered_members` are shown.  It's unclear why one `DigitalInstantiation` might be not getting added as an ordered member, while others are; the code to add the `DigitalInstantiation` to the `Asset` is the same (in the ingest gem and in the actor stack).
 why did you reopen this? Is there additional work that needs to be done?
