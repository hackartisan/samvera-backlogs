Consider getting Fedora to store bytestreams in S3
jrochkind [11:39 AM]  apparently in fedora 4.7 (are we on that?), there is an option in fedora to store binaries in S3, I am told. Not sure if thereâ€™s any docs, when I asked someone pointed me to this, which I donâ€™t know what it means:  (edited) ah, some docs:   dri.ie/sites/default/files/files/building-dri-infrastructure.pdf (edited) daniel [11:42 AM] 4.7.4? Let me check I think we went there. I recall that was in beta a while back but if someone's actually using it in production that's a good sign. Given how rarely we touch the base file the slight speed lose from being off disk shouldn't impact things. jrochkind [11:43 AM] iâ€™m going to make a GH issue with those URLs just to keep track of them as notes. I bet we could save lots of money storing our TBs of bytes on S3 instead of an EBS? Also at least theoretically provides the option to access them from the cloud without going through fedora, although one would have to figure out how to find what one is looking for. Also I have no idea how one would migrate to that when has TBs of data not doing it already. ðŸ™‚
Michael Klein [11:48 AM] Yes, we are [using Fedora S3 in production]. It hasnâ€™t been completely without issues. But itâ€™s also kind of an edge feature right now and will probably stay that way (and therefore immature) until more people commit to using it.
Copying from the chat, we're currently on 4.7.3. According to the doc we'd need to switch to 4.7.4 to handle this. Something to look at as an upgrade option.
