Google Scholar meta-tags improvements
Descriptive summary We have received suggestions for improvement in Google Scholar meta-tags for ScholarsArchive. These updates will help Google Scholar get the metadata needed for proper indexing.   1. Implement GoogleScholarHelper.citation_publication_date to properly format date_created, date_issued, and date_accepted (these fields are used in citation_publication_date meta-tag for Google Scholar) in app/views/shared/_citations.html.erb.  2. Add helper or logic in GoogleScholarHelper to exclude empty meta-tags from view app/views/shared/_citations.html.erb when not available.  3. Update robots.txt to allow Googlebot to access /catalog so that it can access URLs for repository items as well.  4. Run SOLR query to find out if any works are missing a date in date_created, date_issued, and date_accepted.  5. Run SOLR query to find out if there are any dates in the form of date intervals like "2017-12-01/2019-12-01", and check with metadata group to see if we can use the start date in the interval for citation_publication_date meta-tag.  Expected behavior  For checklist item (1) in Descriptive summary above, citation_publication_date expects dates in the formats "2017/12/01‚Äù, "2017/12", "2017", as well as ISO 8601 with the exception of date intervals like "2017-12-01/2019-12-01". For checklist item (2), we have an example where citation_issue, citation_firstpage, and citation_lastpage are still being rendered when the content values are blank:  view-source:     <meta name="citation_issue" content=""/> <meta name="citation_firstpage" content=""/> <meta name="citation_lastpage" content=""/>   The expectation for checklist item (2) is that if we don't have the information, no meta-tags for these fields would be better than empty metatags.  Current behavior  robots.txt is disallowing /catalog for Googlebot. It's preventing the crawler from accessing the browse interface to find items. Fields date_created, date_issued, and date_accepted might sometimes be empty or with invalid format Other citations meta-tags like citation_issue, citation_firstpage, and citation_lastpage are being rendered when blank  Related work #1884
Progress on part 5: I located the items with ranges in `date_created`, `date_issued`, and `date_accepted` and either moved that information to `date_collected` or deleted it. I also updated `date_issued` with correct info as needed.  I created a bulk change list to remove duplicate date-related fields. The `citation_publication_date` meta-tag  should default to `date_issued` as needed.
