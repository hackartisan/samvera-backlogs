Update indexing of nested search fields
Descriptive summary We want all titles for a work to be indexed in title_tesim without any ordering index information. Ensure this continues to be updated on any new edits. This is also where titles for Collections and FileSets are already being indexed. "title_tesim":["Restoring forest health : fire and thinning effects on mixed-conifer forests"],  Titles with ordering index can continue to be stored in the nested_ordered_title_label_ssim stored field for display and edit form purposes. "nested_ordered_title_label_ssim":["Restoring forest health : fire and thinning effects on mixed-conifer forests$0"],  We don't need the ordering information in nested_ordered_title_label_tesim as that is tokenized and split for search, so '$0' and '$1' etc. aren't useful. Also this field can be removed from the 'all fields' search field. "nested_ordered_title_label_tesim":["Restoring forest health : fire and thinning effects on mixed-conifer forests"],  When this is merged we'll need to reindex. Related work Related to #1758 adding title_tesim back in to the 'all fields' search field.
