Importer should not allow multiple Rights Statement or Licenses
ISSUE The CSV importer currently allows me to supply multiple Rights Statements or Licenses.  These will import without error and display on the item show page.  When I edit the item, the UI only allows a singe value in these fields and will only save one of the values. ACCEPTANCE OPTION ONE   Report rows with multiple Rights Statement or License values as warnings   Inform the user that only the first value will be applied    If the user chooses to proceed with the import from the warning screen, only import the first value  OPTION TWO   Report multiple values in the 'Rights StatementorLicense` as a row-level error and do not allow import of that row.
We might also consider filing a bug against Hyrax.  Both `license` and `rights_statement` are defined in `Hyrax::BasicMetadata` to allow multiple values.  It seems like a mis-match to say that a field is multi-value when you are storing or retrieving data, but then design the UI as though it's a single value.
