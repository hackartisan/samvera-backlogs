[Feature] Change default Project (Collection) image to something else

Currently, we're looking to replace the font-awesome "fa fa-cubes" with custom icons created for this project.  Initially, I thought to change the views to include image references to the new images. However, it may be better to create font awesome icons based on what we want. Then, we can modify the configs to use these icons instead of actual images.  Some useful links: *  * 
This may or may not be useful, but if we start with svg, maybe we can convert to the other formats and augment our fonts?  ``` <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body>  <svg height="150" width="175">   <!-- right line -->   <line x1="80" y1="10" x2="130" y2="100" style="stroke:rgb(0,191,255);stroke-width:4" />   <!-- left line -->   <line x1="80" y1="10" x2="30" y2="100" style="stroke:rgb(0,191,255);stroke-width:4" />   <!-- base line -->   <line x1="30" y1="115" x2="130" y2="115" style="stroke:rgb(0,191,255);stroke-width:4" />    <!-- top-mid -->   <circle cx="80" cy="30" r="30" fill="orange" />   <!-- bottom-left -->   <circle cx="30" cy="110" r="30" fill="orange" />   <!-- bottom-right -->   <circle cx="130" cy="110" r="30" fill="orange" /> </svg>  </body> </html> ```
Also, with the migration from Hyrax 1.0.4 to Hyrax 2.0.0 (perhaps before this even), the project icon is now cut off on the top and bottom.  We should figure out why this is happening.  Perhaps creating customized fonts is the way to fix this too.  <img width="1238" alt="screen shot 2018-01-03 at 1 27 29 pm" src="">
