Preserve everything except Music Reserves
This should be the default case, and we need to go back and preserve everything that hasn't been yet. There could be a couple of different ways to do this, the important parts are:  Don't preserve Audio Reserves objects (new or future) Other objects should be preserved by default All current non-Audio Reserves objects should be preserved if they haven't been already
How can one tell if a resource is a music reserve? Are all recordings music reserves?
How about Ephemera? Preserve at the folder level? Box? Project?
For ephemera, I think folders are the right level to preserve.  Music Reserves is harder â€” we can probably identify them by having a call number starting with CD, but I don't know if that gets everything or not.
I don't think we have a reliable way to tell if something is a music reserve. We should talk about this more.  Currently the things I can think of are: - Music reserves are likely to be linked to playlists - Music reserves are likely to have a 'part of' field with a course number - Music reserves are likely to have a bib number source metadata identifier  whereas: - Archival recordings are currently modeled to be nested within another recording resource (a "descriptive proxy") - Archival recordings will have a finding aid id as their source metadata identifier  So there are some things to grab onto here for initial settings, but I don't know that any of this is fair to rely on indefinitely. We'll ingest more things and change stuff around. I think we should talk about this more.
Maybe it should be "only preserve recordings that are part of an archival media collection"?
