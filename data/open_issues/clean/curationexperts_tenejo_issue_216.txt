Sketch the ingest process flow
STORY We all have varying levels of understanding of how the process to create a new work occur. As an engineering manager, I would like a digram of the steps involved in creating a new work in Hyrax, so that our discussions and optimizations can be grounded in a more concrete understanding of the process. NOTE: This activity could easily become a rabbit hole, so let's time box the first iteration and then discuss as a team how much more time we should spend in refinement. DETAILS Use the tenejo single-item upload as a starting point.   If time allows, describe how the darlingtonia import process differs (if it does). ACCEPTANCE   Use a tool that can produce a visual diagram  (whiteboard, google drawings, AutoCad, Adobe Illustrator, balsmiq, pen & paper), this can be supplemented with narrative text as nedded, but I'd like a visual diagram of process flow  Document the user flow (user selects and uploads a file, user adds metadata)  Document the process flow (the characterization actor runs, the virus scanning actor runs)  Indicate which steps occur synchronously vs. which occur asynchronously  Identify what data is provided to each sub-process (i.e. file names, work ids, batch ids, etc.)  Identify what data is returned by each process (i.e. success/error messages, new ids, etc.)
Note - this is clear pre-work for
