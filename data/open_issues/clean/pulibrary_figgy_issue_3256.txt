Determine whether we will support other legacy bag structures
via email from ,  C1372 has extra folders for each barcode, which is not currently accommodated by our bag ingest code C1557 follows a different naming convention  Should we ask for these to be updated or make tickets to accommodate these structures?
 says she updated the structure of the bag (I think C1372) to fit current expectations, but that there are other legacy collections we will need to deal with.
Correct. Both of these bags are good now, with the exception of the .jpg/.JPG issue.
