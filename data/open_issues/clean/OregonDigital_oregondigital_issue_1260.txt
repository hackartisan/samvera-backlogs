Move Locations from TGN to Geonames vocab where possible
Historic place names will remain TGN. All extant place names need to move to Geonames URIs. This is exclusively work for UO in the following collections:  aa-images building-or gb-warner-nosatsu
 An aa-images spreadsheet with new geonames URIs to replace TGNs is in DigitalProjects/Metadata/OD2_Remediation/tgn_cleanup/TGN2Geonames_all.xlsx. There is also a spreadsheet in the same location KeepTGN_all.xlsx for reference.  The new geonames URIs should move to Location (dct:spatial). The tgn URIs should stay in ons:tgn (which will be replaced by the new predicate dbpedia-owl:HistoricPlace)
