Have the controller check the total upload size too
When I upload local files And I choose a file over 0.5gb Then When I add more files The total upload size javascript does not run
 I can't reproduce this locally. Can you run this again with your inspector window open and see if any errors are getting logged to the console?
 It is working now.  Maybe it was a browser issue.  Are you checking the size in the controller also?  Aka the java script is not working will the controller flash a message?
 no, this is client-side only.
Is this still a problem?
Let's find a way to replicate this, then look for a solution; otherwise, close the ticket if it's not a problem.
