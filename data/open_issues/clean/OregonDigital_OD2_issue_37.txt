Broader and narrower terms / alternate titles and names
Descriptive summary Whichever way is decided, we would need to think about caching extra information pulled from endpoints. These pieces of information that would get indexed could help with searching and discovery within OD. For example, we could index alternate titles of subjects, like scientific names of the mandarine orange (Citrus reticulata) so if someone searches for its scientific name, they would be able to find the works that have mandarine orange as its subject. Indexing Broader and Narrower terms could be useful as well depending on how broad and narrow someone went. If someone wanted to search for a mandarine orange, but just searched for orange, or if someone wanted to find the play "Cats" they could search for Play, or Musical, and still find cats. This is all about expanding the discoverability in OD by ten fold. If there are any other ideas that folks have, it could be put here as well. Expected behavior When alternate titles, scientific names, broader or narrower terms are searched for, they bring up the proper works in the search terms. These terms pulled from an endpoint, will be indexed into the proper solr fields and configured for being searched for. Related work Indexing set up, controlled vocabularies set up, end points being hit and pulling proper info, info being indexed. Once all this work is all done and being worked on, this can be done.
Would there be any indication of the broader/narrower relationship in the visible item metadata?
I think we have to show them, somehow. Otherwise you could get a search result for a term you don't ever see on the show page, which will be endlessly confusing.
Agreed
There's an example/mockup on slide 28 here: 
I like that example, but I think maybe we shouldn't display the uri at the end? Also, one question is, how far broader or narrower do we want to go? 
 thoughts on what this should look like?
