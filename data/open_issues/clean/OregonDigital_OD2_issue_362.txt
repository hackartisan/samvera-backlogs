Look into session cookie security concerns
Descriptive summary Multiple developers are seeing their session persisted even after taking the entire stack down, deleted the local mounted tmp directory, and restarting the application.  This suggests the session cookie may contain a user's password rather than just a session id or something similar. Expected behavior The user session should be in a cookie, not their credentials.  Cookie hijacking should, in a worst-case event, allow an attacker to get into OD as a given user (which we can potentially protect against with other mechanisms).  It should never expose their password, because once that's compromised it's much more difficult to prevent the attacker from malicious behavior.
Per  : server-side sessions should be pretty easy to implement
