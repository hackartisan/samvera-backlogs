Relocate and Rewrite "Using the Collection" box (Newspapers Collection) 
Issue: At the very bottom of the Newspapers collection landing page, there is a blue-rimmed box titled "Using the Collection" that purports to give tips on how to search and navigate the Newspaper digital collection.  Work Requested: The "Using the Collection" box should be moved to either a sidebar position or to a spot directly underneath descriptive front-matter on the Collection page in the new repository.  It's content also needs to be rewritten to reflect the actual searching and indexing mechanisms at play.
