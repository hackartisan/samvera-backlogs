Check if we can speed up the repo somehow
Right now it's slower then plants.
Slowest transactions:   To begin with I'm targeting `CollectionsController#index` since it's the most prominent one from the hall of shame in Newrelic.
It's worth noting that this is not going to be an on-going process since there's no silver bullet to speed up all transactions. It comes down to tracking which methods slow down processing with a profiler and fixing them where possible.
Check if moving solr/fedora to own vm will result in a significant speed-up.
Let me know how your tests go and, if you think it's worth it, I'll ask NUIT to give us more resources.

After testing with Fedora on its own server, I don't think we should proceed. The speed up is pretty significant, around 30-40% for most actions. However, the work involved in moving Fedora involves downtime and some risk. Also it'd take a good amount of time to coordinate this with FSMIT and execute.  I think it makes sense to instead spend time on correcting the slowest (, most visible) requests, like we did with the collections index. Which resulted in a really significant speed up (5x or something.) I really believe that just fixing the collections index made us look a ton better. As Austin pointed out the avg request times on the WHOLE site dropped by half.
Ok, that sounds like a good plan. Yes, the load time is still down to half of what it was a few months ago.
