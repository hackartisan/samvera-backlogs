Complete toggle functionality of 'required' fields based on visibility
As defined in the metadata spreadsheet on Sakai, some fields are required based on visibility. For example, an abstract is required if a VDC Resource is made public but not required if it is private. As of release v0.03, only abstract is being toggled for VDC Resources. There should be more fields like this in both VDC Resources and Collections (aka Projects). There wasn't enough time or priority put into getting this implemented, and requirements also changed over time. It should be completed eventually.
I'm including a little bit of description on what's currently in the code regarding this issue.  A related samvera-tech forum thread is here:   I ended up overriding hyrax es6 javascript (relatively clean) to add a new event when visibility is changed by the user.  I also added some new and really ugly non-es6 javascript to do the actual toggling of fields from optional to required.  The best commit is probably here (though it may not be the most recent):   Any related code needs to be updated (possibly revamped) to match requirements in the metadata spreadsheet.
