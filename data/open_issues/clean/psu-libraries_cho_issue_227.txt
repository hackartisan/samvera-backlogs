Enable Browse Everything
Currently, the presence of browse_everything_providers.yml breaks the upload process. I have removed the config file for now so we can upload files, but we need to re-enable this feature. I believe it is not working in Hyrax yet. See: samvera/hyrax#1139
Do we really need browse everything? What does it bring to the table?
 It's up to you. It would allow a user to upload contents from their (or any configured) Box, Google Drive, or other enabled account. Since Penn State does use Box a fair amount, it might be worth it for that, but you would know the use cases more than I. Browse Everything does allow for a single "locally" configured location, which could point to a networked NFS or Samba share that's attached to the server. We've did this with Archivesphere, and it proved useful for uploading large files via the GUI.
We will need an NFS/SMB mount to stage batch loads, so I guess this is more critical than I was thinking originally. (We're not likely to immediately have people loading via Box, though it could be used long-term, just no immediate need.) For MVP, batch loading can be initiated by developers, I'll put this in the production release milestone.
A SMB share is established for batch loading, moving this to the backlog.
