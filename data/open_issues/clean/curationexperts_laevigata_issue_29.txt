Sorting search results
As a general user, after I have completed a keyword search, I would like to be able to sort my results so that I can see the results organized in a specific way. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA   Relevance  Author (alphabetical by last name, first)  Title (alphabetical by first word of the title, excluding quotation marks)**
 **This doesn't seem to be very valuable given how many theses begin with "The." Can we strike this as a requirement?
That's a really good point, ! I tend to agree with you that it's not too valuable. What do you think ?  
Yes, I agree with both of you that it's not too valuable :-)   
There is a bug in active fedora preventing us from indexing creator as sortable. That makes this a significant time investment. Are we sure we want it that badly?
 I wanted to make sure you saw Bess's comment above. Might be worth confirming with Lisa.
Hi Bess. Is this a bug that the fedora community is working on to resolve or is it a long term problem?

 I don't know how long it's going to take to fix. We could work around it, but it'll take more time. It's not an easy fix, is my only point.
 Bess,  Just so I understand the issue correctly. With this bug, if a user does a keyword search, the results they receive cannot be sorted by author/creator but only sorted by relevance. Is that right?

The results they received can be sorted by relevance, date uploaded, and date modified, but not author / creator.
Bess,  I will run this by Lisa to see what she thinks. I know this is creator/sort feature is important but I am not sure how important it is if we have to take time away from other work.  For now, let’s say “we are okay” with not being able to sort by author/creator but I will wait to decide otherwise until we hear back from Lisa.

   I just talked to Lisa and she says since there is currently NO content in new ETDs, she would like to defer this question and possible work to a Post-Launch conversation and potential work. Okay with you?
 Sorry, Fran -- missed your comments on this. Yes, let's talk more.
