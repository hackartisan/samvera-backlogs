Evaluate/improve contrast for accessibility
Per WebX discussion Oct 2015, ensure that the colors used together in the UI meet WCAG contrast standards for accessibility.
Generalized quick assessment:  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ PORTAL PAGE:  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  **FAE report:**   ## WAVE output  ### Errors:  (2) missing form label --> - 'search' box (only using placeholder) - timeline slider (not sure how best to fix this)  (1) empty button --> - 'go' button for mast search (add text and hide it)  (11) empty link --> - feature images (add title text and position behind images?)   []  broken ARIA reference --> - aria-labelledby="modal menu" needs a target  ### Alerts:  suspicious/duplicate alt text --> change 'featured image' to just be empty (these are just decorative)  unlabeled form element --> select menu for top search (can probably ignore for now, hopefully intuitive as-is?)  skipped heading level --> doesn't like that we skipped h2 and h3, not a big deal  suspicious/duplicate link text --> doesn't like our 'more >>' links (could probably give them a title, like 'read more about <the subject matter>)  ### very low contrast warnings: - white on green in alert bar (2.3:1)   -- to reach 4:1, green (#a1b70d) should be more like #778808   -- (we use this combo on the library site, worth fixing here?) - grey 'contact' under rubenstein link (2.8:1)   -- to reach 4.5:1, grey (#999) should be more like (#777) - grey text inside of 'source collection' box   -- to reach 4.5:1, lighten well from (#f5f5f5) to (#f9f9f9), darken text from (#999) to (#737373) - grey text 'by' and 'xx months ago' under from our blog   -- to reach 4.5:1, grey (#999) should be more like (#777) - footer grey text   -- to reach 4.5:1, lighten well from (#f5f5f5) to (#f9f9f9), darken text from (#999) to (#737373)  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ITEM PAGE:  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  *_FAE report: *_   ## WAVE output  ### Errors:  (8) missing form label --> - header same as on portal page - rest are related to download links / page jumper?  (8) empty button --> - header same as on portal page - rest are in the seadragon output?  (1) empty link --> - not sure, seadragon image?  (1) broken ARIA reference --> - same as portal page  ### Alerts:  (1) unlabeled form element --> same as portal page, safe to ignore?  (1) skipped heading level --> safe to ignore?  (1) noscript element --> seadragon interface, safe to ignore? - general note: could we include some helper text for using a keyboard to navigate openseadragon(   Also, the 'image reference strip' seems to not allow for selecting a new page via keyboard only, unless I'm missing something...  ### very low contrast warnings: - (19) instances of grey (#999) on white (2.8:1)   -- to reach 4.5:1, grey (#999) should be more like (#777) - footer text same as portal page (#999 on #f5f5f5)   -- to reach 4.5:1, lighten well from (#f5f5f5) to (#f9f9f9), darken text from (#999) to (#737373) 
This is really helpful. Looks like we have a lot of areas for followup.  
Cool – thanks!  I think most of the issues should be pretty easy to mitigate.   The only thing that really stands out to me as being problematic for real-world use is keyboard navigability of the ‘reference strip’ with multi-image items (although I just noticed this is already a tracked issue - doh!)
