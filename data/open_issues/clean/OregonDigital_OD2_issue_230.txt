Figure out notification and email policy
Descriptive summary Hyrax, by default, does not send emails to users. Instead, they use the mailboxer gem to send in-app notifications. ScholarsArchive configured mailboxer to send emails to users when they receive a notification:  Expected behavior Decisions made on:   Should we do the same for OD2?  Can we configure mailboxer to only send emails on certain notifications?  Who should be emailed under what conditions? (workflow change, oEmbed errors, new user, etc)  Related work Simplifies #77 Discussion and discovery on PR #221 Relevant work on SA:  Hyrax documentation about notifications/emails:  - should be noted, the only mention of ActionMailer in code is for the contact form
   can you put heads together to sort out an initial set of use cases for email notifications in OD2 and drop them into this issue?
Relates to #276 
For us: - User error notifications, i.e. if a patron is getting an error it would be nice for us to know about it right away so we can investigate it rather than relying on the patron to report it. - Bulk task errors - Analytics--could we bake in a monthly/quarterly/yearly summary report for admins?   For patrons: - Service disruptions/long maintenance - UX surveys (optional?) - New functionality announcements (optional?) - New collection announcements (optional?) - Password resets - Copy of Contact Form submission - Account maintenance/deletion
After discussion -  For us:  Explore possibilities of "something went wrong" errors Bulk task errors, yes (might need beyond what Hyrax offers) - needs broken down Analytics notification probably not MVP (and could be part of grant?) Derivatives Workflow notifications [in app]  For patrons: Improved 404/etc type error messages for end users Service disruptions/long maintenance [in page] UX surveys (optional?) [probably just email on our own - no automation] New functionality announcements (optional?) [probably just email on our own - no automation] New collection announcements (optional?) [probably just email on our own - no automation] Password resets [exists] Copy of Contact Form submission [needed] Account maintenance/deletion [needed, user data discussion - GDPR, etc.]
