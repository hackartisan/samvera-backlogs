use lafayette site fonts?
it'd be nice if we could use the same fonts as the college's other websites. from the source, it looks like we're using fonts from typography.com, which redirect to a lafayette cdn. might be worth asking what the best practice is for us using the fonts are, since i believe we're paying for them. leftover from #155
