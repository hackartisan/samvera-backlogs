Ingest "Moscow Kamerny Theater" (pudl0113)
These don't seem to be displayed anywhere. Ingest? Ping  
 This looks like  â€” Veridian?
Yes -- Thomas Keenan hand-processed this title a few years ago, but we could never figure out exactly where to put it.
Do we have Alto for these? I didn't think we did. Could they go into figy as an MVW?
Let me see if I can find the METS/ALTO for it.
