License change of an embargoed object post-embargo overwrites all rightsMD
Compare:  (the successful embargo release) with  Situation occurred where an object was released from embargo by the automated process. However, the user went back into the Hydrus app three days later and changed the license. It looks like Hydrus was unaware of the embargo release (which updates the rightsMD metadata stream) and simply overwrote that datastream with the stale pre-embargo-release data (effectively re-embargoing the object).  - do you have further thoughts? I'm filing this ticket not so much with the expectation that this get fixed (it's something of an edge case) but mainly to signal that this is something to watch out for in whatever application replaces Hydrus eventually.
After consulting with  - to clarify, it was the versioning of the object **in Hydrus** that caused the problem. That is, resubmitting the object from the Hydrus side caused full reassembly and rightsMD replacement.
