Re-ordering of DAMS elements in the UI
From dams-metadata created by hjsyoo: ucsdlib/dams-metadata#56 Summary Proposing a re-ordering of DAMS elements, as listed in the second column of  Prior to re-ordering, a new field, Cite This Work, is proposed: ucsdlib/damsmanager#368 Rationale Currently, the various Note types in the ranking are broken up by the Subject types, into two rough groupings.

This pushes important information such as Related Publications and Technical Details toward the bottom of the page.
