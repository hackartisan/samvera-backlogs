GET requests to /catalog/:id/track generated in the log during usability testing 
There are some fatal errors in the log that occurred during the testing, all of which look like this (with different pids): 13:43:42 INFO: Started GET "/catalog/duke:696/track" for 10.191.5.9 at 2015-10-07 13:43:42 -0400  13:43:42 FATAL:  ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches [GET] "/catalog/duke:696/track"):  That route only exists for POST requests and shouldn't be exposed in the interface. I think this track URL is used by Blacklight to log to the database information about searches. There may be an issue related to sessions starting/ending and use of the back button.
