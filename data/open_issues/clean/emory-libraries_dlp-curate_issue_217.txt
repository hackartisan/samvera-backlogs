Event - Fixity Checking
Story As a Preservation Curator, I want to run a Fixity Check service on my objects, so that I can monitor for changes to all the files associated with an object or more broadly across the whole repository Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes Our assumption is for v.1, we can run fixity checks only on SHA1, because that is consistently assigned to all files. Links to Additional Information Approved Preservation Events & Workflows Preservation - Metadata Properties Needed List of all Preservation UI Mockups Checklist   If using Fedora 4's fixity service, runs fixity checks on all files using their SHA1 checksum  Runs on a schedule (at least quarterly) for the whole repository  Logs results to common Preservation Events metadata  Records if fixity checks pass, fail, or skipped for all files within a given work [CONFIRM: do we log all outcomes or only failures?]  If fixity check fails, a record of which files failed within a given object is added to the log  Discuss as enhancements or 0.5 work  Fixity check outcomes can be displayed in the Curate UI or used for staff reporting (e.g. fixity check outcome reports across the repository) Event can be requested through the Curate UI (Edit Work form or a new Manage Preservation form) Can be run on demand for individual objects (see Events form mockups)  Deferred Enhancements  Is automatically run as part of multiple Preservation Workflows (Ingest, Dissemination, Versioning) Provides checking for one or more Curate-generated checksum types (see Epic #210): for v.1, SHA1  Given/When/Then  Given (some context) and (some other optional context) When (some action is carried out) Then (a set of observable consequences should occur)
