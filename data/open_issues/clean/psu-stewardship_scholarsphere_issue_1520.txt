BePress Reporting
I thought we may have had something in here similar, but I wasn't able to find it. As a user I would like to receive a monthly report about how many times my files have been downloaded and my total downloads, via email, with a link to my dashboard. This is common in BePress. I'm attaching a screen shot of that. (may be worth noting this request came in from users).
Send an email to all the depositor On the 1st of each month if they had downloads.  Let them know how many downloads on files they had in the  the last month, and total downloads.  Link to the dashboard.  Information should be coming from ScholarSphere ().   Should have the ability to opt out of the emails.  By default the users will be subscribed.  For the first iteration we will allow the mail system to just bounce the emails.  In future we may want to check LDAP to make sure the person is still valid.  WE can also look at simplifying the opt out mechanism in the future.  1. Email template 1. Report generator 1. Profile opt out flag - Unsubscribe
 will provide updated email content to update

 Did you want "Dear Cynthia" instead of just "Author"? Or use full name instead of just the given name?
It would be great if it said "Dear Cynthia"!!
 I'd like to add a sentence to the end of the email with a link to the opt out checkbox in the user profile. The user profile is a feature in SS that doesn't get used/seen very much, so I think a little more instruction on how to opt out would be good.
