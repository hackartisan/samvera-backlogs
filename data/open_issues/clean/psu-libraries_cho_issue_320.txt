Creating new work types
As a metadata librarian I want to define fields options and settings on an existing work type All work types will already be present in the system, and the user is specifying their field refinements such as display name, controlled vocabulary, etc. For more detailed information about the workflow, see  This was formerly #57.
For MVP, basic work types will be hard coded into the app. Future enhancement will give UI interface to creating work types.
