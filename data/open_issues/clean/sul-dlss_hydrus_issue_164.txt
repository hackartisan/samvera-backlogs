auth'ed user should be able to create collection, but cannot
user's SUNet is scherrer workgroup is dlss:hydrus-app-collection-creators When logged in, should be able to see the "create a new collection" button, but it does not appear. User reports he is using the "latest version of Firefox on Windows 7"
For this user (scherrer), I went ahead and created a new collection on their behalf, gave them a role in the collection, and then scherrer was able to use the application.  Another test with another new user to the dlss:hydrus-app-collection-creators workgroup confirmed the eerroneous behavior.  Could it be that new members in the workgroup are not getting indexed into Hydrus' Solr? 
 is it possible that this workgroup name has become an issue with the changes you are making related to argo?
