Improve on Image Viewer Responsiveness
Descriptive summary The image viewer is slow to display images of significant size.  Once images are loaded into cache - which can be a slow process, the image may display with reasonable time, but only until the cache is cleared.   The current implementation of the Universal Image Viewer should be fine-tuned and improved, and/or consider replacing RIIIF with LORAX.  See  Expected behavior Images appear in acceptable response time. Actual behavior Response time can be slow to the point that it can appear to the user that the image itself is vacant or permanently out of focus. Steps to reproduce the behavior I can provide examples of large images when this issue is taken up.
