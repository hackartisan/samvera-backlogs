Users should be able to opt-in to receive a notification/alert when new summaries are uploaded
We would like users to be able to opt-in to receive an alert when a new summary is added to OASIS. Relate to #182
  This is different to issue #127 , as that issue asks that users can set up an alert for an individual search term. Would it also be possible for users to receive a general notification when **anything** is uploaded to OASIS? This would be particularly useful as some of our partner organisations would like to set up a blog of new summaries as they appear. We have also had requests from individuals to be able to receive an alert for new summaries. Is there some functionality already available within the software for notifications/alerts? Or would it require some research to find out about whether notifications/alerts are possible within the software?   (  for info) 
 We need to explore this further. I would expect, that this should be supported by simple RSS feed. A user would be able to use some free services to channel a feed to an email account. Sadly, I can't see that this has been implemented at Hyrax.
### Implementation ideas - Create _/atom_ route and produce an atom.xml feed from all content (see [ruby rss module]( - Produce daily atom.xml file from Solr search XML (see [xslt examples]( File will be served from _/public_ path.
