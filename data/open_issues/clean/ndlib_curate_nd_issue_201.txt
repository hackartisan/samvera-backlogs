Add standard DOI formatting to DOI field in CurateND
See  CurateND does not enforce a standard format of DOI data entry.  The values entered into CurateND should adhere to the DOI format as outlined here. 
From the DOI Specification:  > A DOI name may be represented as a URL (http string) by prefacing the string with  (or ) to the DOI of the document (e.g., to resolve the DOI name 10.1000/182, enter into a browser the address:  Web pages or other hypertext documents can include hypertext links in this form.  So our sanitization can strip any doi.org or dx.doi.org prefix. Below is what I believe to be regular expression to sanitize.  ``` ruby %r{^(https?://)?(dx.)?doi.org/} ``` 
Don't spend time working on validating the format; Instead spend time stripping the possible prefixes for domains. 
I think a better regexp is along the line of s/^.*10./10./ that is, strip everything up to the initial "10.", and then make sure it starts with "10.". 
Example record: `und:mk61rf58938`  
I went to the example record and I do not see a DOI. It does not appear on the show page. 
Currently, DOIs aren't displaying at all records at all. For example, I made:    I'm not seeing it in  etc.  Metadata includes a DOI.  info:fedora/und:tx31qf88686  "2016-05-24Z"^^ . info:fedora/und:tx31qf88686  "DOI Tester document" . info:fedora/und:tx31qf88686  "Ruth Tillman" . info:fedora/und:tx31qf88686  "Yadda Yadda, oh c'mon that's not a typo." . info:fedora/und:tx31qf88686  "" . info:fedora/und:tx31qf88686  "2016-05-24" . info:fedora/und:tx31qf88686  "University of Notre Dame" . info:fedora/und:tx31qf88686  "English" . info:fedora/und:tx31qf88686  "" . info:fedora/und:tx31qf88686  "" . info:fedora/und:tx31qf88686  "All rights reserved" . info:fedora/und:tx31qf88686  "2016-05-24Z"^^ . info:fedora/und:tx31qf88686  "doi:10.5072/FK2K35S727" . 
DOIs are not shown with the rest of the attributes, although I suppose they could be. ![curatend-201-dois-in-curatend](  ## DOIs in CurateND  | Work Type | Form | View† | | :-- | :-- | :-- | | Article | Yes | Yes | | Dataset | Yes | Yes | | Document | Yes | Yes | | ETD | Yes | Yes | | Finding Aid | No | No‡ | | Image | Yes | Yes | | Patent | No | No‡ | | Senior Thesis | Yes | Yes‡ |  †: shown via `app/views/curation_concern/base/_doi.html.erb`   ‡: has its own `show.html.erb` which does not include the DOI partial   is this the right behavior for the different work types? 
I like displaying the doi in the attribute field, for what it's worth. 
I'm ok breaking it out with the message but I would also be ok along with  to see it in an attribute field.  The show work types looks good to me.
