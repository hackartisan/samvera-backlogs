Improve error page generation
There are four methods of generating error pages in CurateND.  Via StaticPagesController; views rendered in app/views/static_pages/error.html.erb e.g.  Via ErrorsController; views in app/views/errors/* e.g.  (URL example throws a 404) Via static page e.g. public/503.html;  Via nginx default e.g.   This should be simplified.   Consolidate the two different methods of generating error pages. Exposing the form for submitting an error report used by the StaticPagesController method is a good idea. The error-specific message, like 404, used by ErrorsController is a good idea. Having two controllers responsible for templating error messages is a bad idea.  Leave the self-contained static page for a 503 error in place. It is necessary for when the application itself has been shut down.  Remove the default nginx 500 error page or add a public/500.html based on public/503.html   This technical debt was discovered while investigating #364
