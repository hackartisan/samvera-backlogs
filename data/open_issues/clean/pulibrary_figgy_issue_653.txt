Ephemera Folder form should warn when folder number has already been used within parent
As captured during a meeting held on 12/08/17, at least a warning should be issued when duplicated Folder barcodes or numbers are entered
There's a test for this here:   Weird that it's not working.
I believe the original issue was with "Save and Create Another" â€” when it wasn't providing a flash message, they clicked the button several times because nothing seemed to happen.  So maybe we should consider validating uniqueness of these fields?
