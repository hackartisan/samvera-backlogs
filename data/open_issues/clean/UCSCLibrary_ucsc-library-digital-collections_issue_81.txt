Issues with several individual files for Hitchcock recordings
Several works in the 1976-77 History of Western Civ collection are not playing on the object pages. Not playing means, I hit play and nothing happens. In the multiple track player on the main page, the wrong lecture plays when one of these records is selected.  My suggestion is to unpublish the problematic recordings and troubleshoot them later.  When I hit the edit button on those works, the system displays the error message: "We're sorry, but something went wrong. If you are the application owner check the logs for more information." Example url: 
The problematic works are: Track 3 (plays GD answering machine)   Track 13 (doesn't play, displays object icon instead of audio icon)   Track 14  Track 15   Track 16   Track 23   Track 24   Track 25   Track 26   Track 27 (plays, not Hitchcock though)   Track 31   Track 32
