Citation export
As a researcher, I would like to export standard citations for objects in the repository to my citation management software, so that I can easily reference the material in my research later.
Metadata question not functionality. 
Similar to WorldCat functionality.  Desired exports: Mendeley, RefWorks, EndNote, EasyBib, Zotero
 What metadata would we use for works/objects vs collections?
This functionality already exists in Blacklight to allow us to export citations.
