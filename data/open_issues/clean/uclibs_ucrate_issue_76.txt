Questions about this one:  * Thomas's question above - should we be able to accomplish this by filtering by collection on the dashboard, and then selecting all works for batch edit?   * Note that this filter doesn't seem to work, as-is (e.g., I have a collection in my local environment, but it's only showing "Default Admin Set") * Should the batch edit support both works and sub-collections? * Do we already have support for batch-editing different classes simultaneously?
