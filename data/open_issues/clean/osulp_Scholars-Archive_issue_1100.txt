Clean up isPartOf content
Member vantuyls commented on May 22 Some content that moved from DSpace to Hydra used the mythical predicate isPartOfSeries and was, largely, a combination of Journal Title, Volume, and Number. We forewent cleaning this up pre-migration (because there wasn't a place to put the Volume and Number values in DSpace) in favor of cleaning these up post-migration. SO: in the spreadsheet linked below, please clean up the metadata by separating Journal Title, Volume, Number and any additional information into appropriate form fields.  vantuyls added the Post-Migration Work label on May 22  vantuyls referenced this issue on May 22 Closed Create spreadsheet of dspace items wiht ispartofseries #37 0 of 2 tasks complete  mlv611 commented on May 22  Where is the spreadsheet?  Member vantuyls commented on May 23 it hasn't been created yet.  is going to generate it soon.  Member zhang4952 commented on May 25 â€¢ The spreadsheet is in the Google drive:  there are ~21,000 items with legitimate values. It will take 'significant' effort to clean it because they are in wide spreading formats.  
 project!
Sarah continues to work on this.
