Suggest feature for date keywords
Users were confused when they searched for "18th century" and found that 2 out of 3 of the hits weren't 18th century (those words were in the description). Possibly add a suggested text "Did you mean [facet to date or subject that's more relevant"  found another website that does this.
Example from this ticket:   ![ravelrysearchsuggestfilter](  (this is from after the search results have loaded)
not easy to do. will have to prioritize cost/benefit. I wonder if addressing some of #770 would eliminate need here, for "date" queries specifically.
