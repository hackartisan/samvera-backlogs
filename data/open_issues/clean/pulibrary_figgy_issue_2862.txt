Creating a bulk add feature for assigning collections to already ingested items?
is this possible? Example: adding another collection (ex: Edith Wharton) to items within an already assigned collection: âœ“&q=Edith+Wharton+Manuscripts+C0118
 Yes, we plan to add a few more things to the bulk edit screen: 1. collection membership 2. rights statement 3. preservation policy  See #2586 and #2842  So far, we have assumed that all the items being bulk edited would be in a single collection, and we only show the bulk edit button when the search is limited to a collection (to limit the potential for accidental system-wide changes).  That is true for the Edith Wharton items (where they are all in the Manuscripts collection).  But I'd appreciate feedback on other scenarios where that might not be the case.
Absolutely, re: feedback. this one actually came from Squirrel in RBSC, and I thought it was a good idea as well (Edith Wharton's stuff is currently in 2 collections: MSS and one other, hence the want to create a new collection for them).
