Speed Up Capistrano Deploys
Current capistrano deploy time is 11-15 minutes, from my research the two slowest steps of the deploy are:   Compiling JavaScript assets, this usually takes around 8 minutes 30 seconds. This could be sped up by compiling javasript assets locally then rsync them to the ec2.   Cleanup old deploys. This is conditional, if there is a high number of releases on the box(usually due to large number of failed deploys) this step can take as long as 10 minutes to clean off 8+ release folders. If there is the normal six releases, with one needing to be deleted, this step will take about 30 seconds. This step is largely responsible for the variance in deploy times.   Considering these options I believe compiling assets locally will consistently lower deploy time. There is a capistrano gem designed to do this at  Using this gem may require changes on the deployer's laptop and possible package.json changes that I will need SE's help with. For 2) we could disable cleanup of old repos during deploys and create an Ansible job that will periodically trim old releases.
