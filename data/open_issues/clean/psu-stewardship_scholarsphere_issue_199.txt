User Department in ScholarSphere is blank when psu.edu has data

It seems ScholarSphere can get this information, since when I run  `User.where(login:'amm81')[0].populate_attributes the department is present.`  I updated all LDAP information in the production system:   ```  User.all.each {|u|  u.populate_attributes; u.save} ```  About half the users still have a blank department.  A sampling of those seem to be students. For example smm6714 has no department, but does have a curriculum  ``` Name: STAMATINA MATTIE MYLONAS E-mail:  Phone: +1 610 446 3507 Title: UNDERGRAD STUDENT Address: 1813 LAWRENCE RD HAVERTOWN, PA 19083 Campus: BRANDYWINE CAMPUS Curriculum: COMMUNICATION ARTS AND SCIENCES ```
