Object Report
As a repository manager, I would like to know the number of objects, by content type, by date(s), by collection (including those without a collection), by version status, and by workflow step status (mediation), So that I may include the information in other reports about CHO.
Hyrax Analyticx Working Group will produce recommendations for item-level stats 
We also need a way to count the number of "preservation master" files within an object. Annual reporting often asks for things in terms of page-count or scan-count.
