Set Creative Commons license on ingest for certain collections
In sprint 10, this metadata was set on an ad-hoc basis w/ a rake task (#349). Now the californica importer needs to be modified to do this on every ingest. Acceptance:   [Non-Preferred] A list of CC-licensed collections is set somewhere in config. Initially it will contain only ladnn, but it should be a list we can add other collections to in the future.  [Preferred] The user selects the cc-license at the time of import (initially via a parameter, later via a GUI)  CC-by license is set on ingest, if a work's collection is in that list.
