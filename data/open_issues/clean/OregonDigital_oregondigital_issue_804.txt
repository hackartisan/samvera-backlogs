Document Search Slow - Text
Within document viewer search is very slow and it is hard to tell if there is even text behind to search.  Problem record:  If there is text, can we look into the slowness? If not text, is there a way to notify the user that search is hopeless?
Yup, documents with lots of text are going to be slow because it's searching via ruby. I've talked to  about how we could move it into solr, but so far I've been unable to get something figured out. The problem is we need phrase searching on a tagged document, where it should ignore the tags for search but return a result WITH the tags so that we can get the x/y coordinates on the page from it. 
may get more info from IIIF work? maybe PDF JS as long as it meets our needs?  recommends tabling to F4/Hydra x 
I think pdj.js can satisfy some of our requirements, maybe all of them if we're willing to get our hands slightly dirty.  For instance, here's a solution to do a search and auto-highlight-all:  ``` javascript PDFFindBar.open(); //optional if you want to show the search bar PDFFindBar.findField.value = 'your search term'; PDFFindBar.highlightAll.checked= true; PDFFindBar.findNextButton.click(); ```  (More details on search/page from URL:
