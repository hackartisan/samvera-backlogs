Responsive Universal Viewer
As a researcher using maps, I would like the default size of the universal viewer to be large, So that it's easier to see and navigate across large items, such as digitized maps. User Story from Stephanie M. As a researcher/student working in the visual arts, I need to be able to quickly toggle to a full page display of an image from the object page (and vice versa) So that the details of the entire image are more clearly visible (this is different from zooming into an image in order to see details of sections of an image) Additional user story from Catherine A. As an instructor/student user I want the option of different size downloads so that images can be used in power point, word, publication etc. Viewer should be responsive and re-size according to device, with easy ability to enter/exit full-screen. Default width should be close to page width.
Hyku download integration with viewer using IIIF: 
listing of support? Nathan to compile and put in the comments. 3D objects will be the hardest, but is not in MVP.  Grant for 3D is longer than CHO. Will have that need 6 months after production release separate ticket for it.  Integrate viewer and make sure that it is responsive. Viewer does not support PDF.  There is another project that has it. May not be a show stopper, but the UX will be better if it did support PDF. Is there conversion for tiling and zooming? JP2's will be made outside of CHO.
Universal Viewer is primarily aimed at still images. Needs to support JP2 images. Derivatives will be pre-generated from TIFF (and perhaps occasionally JPG) and will be included with batch loads or GUI input form.  The digital file may be an image, but the original material may be a map, manuscript, document (posters, news clippings, letters, business cards, sheet music), photographs/slides/negatives, paintings/artwork, or blueprints/plans. [This list may not be exhaustive but gives a good sense.]
Universal Viewer doesn't seem to be responsive...
