Make abstract not required for Documents type Book.
Is it possible to preface an issue with a heavy sigh and apology? If so, please consider this prefaced. It's been decided, and for the best, I think, that Book objects should not necessarily have abstracts. This isn't necessarily an issue for the batch ingester, but means that editing Books in the system leads to errors unless one puts in a " ". If one puts in a " " (as I have for now but I'll batch ingest overwrite tomorrow to remove entirely), an abstract exists, gets indexed, displays in search results. Which looks like nothing. Which is pretty ugly.
This issue requires toggling HTML5 required attributes on the abstract field as well as the visibility of the associated “required field” indicator.  Toggling the client-side enforcement of abstracts may be able to piggy-back on existing book-specific JavaScript behavior. `formInputMask` ([`app/assets/javascripts/curate/form_input_mask.js`]( simply toggles fields between visible/invisible; it will need to be extended to toggle required attributes. 
DLTP-577 tracks this.
