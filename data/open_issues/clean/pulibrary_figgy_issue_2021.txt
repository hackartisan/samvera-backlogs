We received the following report in SN@P that these items were mislabeled:  Not Cottage but Cuyler Hall    AC045  Not Colonial but Cottage   AC045  Not Charter Club but Chemical Laboratory    AC045  Not Ivy But Cottage    AD02 7810    AD02 7811  Not Ivy But Holder Hall    MP52 1836  Not Ivy Maybe Stafford Little Hall    AD02 7813  Not Tower But Ivy    SP07 1632   Once we let Christa know what the spreadsheet should look like she will send us updates to run.
Sent a message to Alexis in Slack asking what they do when patrons report incorrect descriptive metadata
Christa and Lynn will work on getting corrections made where they have been reported. This is not a blocker to migrating this collection or making it public, as the data is wrong in pudl already.  We need to send them specifications for the CSV / spreadsheet to get the corrections into figgy.
