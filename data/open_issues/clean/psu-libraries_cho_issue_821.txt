Agent resource enhancements
Currently agent resources have only three properties: id, surname, and given_name. Agents can also be corporations and families. We will need an expanded schema for agents that can handle all three types of agents. Potential models are MADS and EAC-CPF, but both are overkill for our current needs.  Do we need to separate surname and given name? Or distinguish between a corporation, person, or family? Can we just have a property called agent that can be any string? We also need to identify the source vocabulary, see #5. What type of data will Questioning Authority pull in? See #734.  The resulting schema for agents should be documented in the wiki.

TODO: * Linda can provide the details needed, such as what additional fields/properties are needed for the agent resource
