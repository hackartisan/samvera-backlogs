IIIF Image Viewer (IV): visibility of image from public to private
Descriptive summary Though this use case is very rare, when an image's visibility is changed from public to private, the IV continues to display the image. We should discuss if we have to clean up cache more often. Research if this can be fixed without having to clean up cache. Verify that IV indeed displays private images when a different user or no user is logged in. Expected behavior IV should not display private images Actual behavior IV displays private images when public image were made private. This does not happen when an image is added to a work as a private image. Steps to reproduce the behavior  Create a work with an image with visibility Public. Wait for Imagemagick to process the images and verify that IV does display the respective image. Edit the work to make the work/image image private. IV continues to display even after making the image private.  Related work #60 #116 #117
