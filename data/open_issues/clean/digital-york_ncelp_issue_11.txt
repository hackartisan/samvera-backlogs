Download survey
Create a new model for survey, link it to Resource model, and update UI

I get an error message when I try to save & submit the survey. <img width="824" alt="Screenshot 2019-04-12 at 10 10 24" src=""> 
Sorry I was updating the server, please could you try again?
Yes, works fine now!
