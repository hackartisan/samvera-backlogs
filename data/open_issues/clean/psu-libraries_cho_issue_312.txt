AD95 compliance
CHO data compliance for AD95 AWS can't use level 4 (credit cards), and possibly level 3 (HIPA). I don't think CHO will have any data  like that?
CHO shouldn't have HIPA, but it may have PII. Access derivatives will have it redacted, but the digital masters won't.
This also affects AWS cloud service storage, if we elect to store files in S3 for example.
We need to keep  updated on this, she's involved in coordinating library information security per [AD95](
We need to get more information from PSU-involved groups and find out what the correct course of action is.
