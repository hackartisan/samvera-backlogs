Integrate with ScienceDirect API
Will Symplectic or other items in the queue for DigitalHub address this, or is something that should be put on the DigitalHub enhancements wish list? ScienceDirect API /free/  ScienceDirect can share article metadata and full text directly with the institutional repository, so the university’s output has a better chance of being found by users and showcased within the institutional repository. – See more at:  I’m writing a short session report for a newsletter on a Charleston Conference session at which one of the librarians from University of Florida spoke about their experience. The API sounds interesting (if I understood it, it checks entitlements and passes users through to the final version in SD if they are valid users, and to the final manuscript, if not). Florida’s interest was because Elsevier is such a major medical publisher. (1100 or 8000 U of FL publications is one figure dropped) Ramune
