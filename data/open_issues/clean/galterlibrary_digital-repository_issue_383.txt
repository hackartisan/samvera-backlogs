Fill out and submit Google Scholar Inclusion form
(thanks )
We revisited this request and have decided not to follow through with this feature in DigitalHub.   Google Scholars guide to inclusion:    GS recommends Eprints, Digital Commons, or DSpace for university repositories. Since we don't use one of those, we must check to make sure our system meets all of the requirements to enable crawling and indexing of our content. While we meet many of the requirements in the list...     ...we do not meet the requirement that PDF-formatted files end with '.PDF'. This is due to the way that our repository software stores and displays file names. This means that GS won't know these files are of type PDF and therefore won't index them. Since the vast majority of our content is in PDF format, this affects most of the repository.  Instead, we will focus our effort on the Invenio-based repo/index and make sure that we meet all criteria so that the content in our new system will be indexed in Google Scholars.
