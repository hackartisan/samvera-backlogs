Solr 7.3 and Java 10
Solr 7.1 appears to be incompatible with Java 10. Solr 7.3, however, appears to be fine. We will need to decide how we want to coordinate our Java versions  with our local systems vs. server systems. Java may need to be limited to version 9, or we could decide to upgrade to Solr 7.3 now, provided it is backwards compatible with our existing Java versions.
Solr 7.3 is compatible with Java 9 and 10. For now, just use Java 8, the version that's on the server.
