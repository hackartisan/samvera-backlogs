resque workers sometimes spin on soft shutdown
A preproduction deploy to curate_nd on 2/12 failed, waiting for the resque workers to restart. Doing a ps on the pprd worker, I see that the master worker thread says [shutdown in progress], but never finishes. I attempted to restart it via  the service interface (service resque-poold restart) to no avail, and ended up have to issue a hard kill -9 to the resque-pool-master daemon. This had occurred a number of times before in both prod and pprd deploys. My first guess is that the master is waiting for all its kids to die before exiting, but for some reason, this doesn't happen.
Just a comment. It looks like we are using a really old version (from 2012) of resque-pool (the gem which manages these resque workers.) The most recent version is 0.6.0, but the version we have is pegged to 0.3.0 by sufia-models.
