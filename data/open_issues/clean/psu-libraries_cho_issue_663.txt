Minting ARKs
We need to mint ARKs so that we can add them to works and collections and have persistent urls for them.
It's not clear how we would mint arks, such as what service to use. The work we're doing with DataCite in Scholarsphere might serve as an example. Also, would every collection and work receive an ARK or would we selectively mint these as needed?  TODO: * determine a service or process for creating an ARK, such as gem to use * define conditions for which ARKs are minted * provide mechanism for minting ARKs for existing works and collections
 Princeton mints them with EZID 
TODO: * need to know restrictions on name length: can we use a shortened UUID? * setup NOID minting service, if needed * internal process to "create" the full ARK url * use existing data dictionary term or create new one so the ARK can be exported, displayed, etc.   * possibly use Valkyrie alternate_id property * DNS aliases for qa, staging and production:   * id-qa.libraries.psu.edu --> cho-qa   * id-staging.libraries.psu.edu --> cho-staging   * id.libraries.psu.edu --> (production) * Write controller to forward requests to id* names to the appropriate show view   * ex.  redirects to /catalog/xxxxyyy (or appropriate show view)  When the time comes to move to a centralized service for minting ids, we can prevent collisions with existing locally-minted IDs in CHO by changing the length of the id. Prefixing or postfixing, as per the ARK spec., could be of use here.
