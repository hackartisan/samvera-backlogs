Cleanup stray files and filesets
Due to ingest and deletion errors, we have a significant number of unattached FileSets, with TIFFs and JP2s on disk.  We should identify all files and FileSets that aren't attached to works and delete them. Rake task or Thor command to check every file on disk and see if it's linked to by a resource. Iterate over every file, see if a fileset exists. If no, delete. StorageAdapter doesn't have #all so probably just use Dir. Iterate over every file_set, delete if it has no parent. An option for safety is to move all the files to a new location, then validate that all the objects have files before actually deleting. This seems both low-priority and high-risk. Delay until we have a mirror of the data.
