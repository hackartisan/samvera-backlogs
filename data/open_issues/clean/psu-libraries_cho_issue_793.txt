Persist Objects to Preservation Storage
As a digital preservation librarian, I would like CHO objects and their associated properties to persist to preservation storage, So that there is an archival copy of all content at all times. Questions and Notes  Files should persist to preservation storage on a regular basis. To be determined if this is triggered by an event such as creation/modification OR if there is a nightly process where any changed content is persisted. Files should be stored in the Oxford Common Filesystem Layout  Files should be versioned and all versions retained. At some point, CHO should be able to reingest these old versions to rollback changes. Until then, files can be retrieved from storage and restored manually. Files should be stored on a network location using a modern filesystem that includes error checking, such as ZFS or GlusterFS. Files should be readable by staff in the Preservation, Conservation, Digitization department.   Objects include collections (without works themselves, but a machine-readable list of work members), works (with filesets and files)  ? Any reason to have filesets or files as their own objects in persistence store? Preservation preferences simplicity. Which files (suffix/use_types) should be sent to the preservation store? Does it vary by work type?   Everything is stored by the PSU Identifier (e.g. pstsc_05255_014319fd22f7cf8eee33d5e76ac4fc71) Metadata stored as CSV with each object, including collections. Should include derived properties, not just supplied properties.
