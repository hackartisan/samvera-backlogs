Figure out how to include Ace EPUB Accessibility checker into ingest/monograph workflow
The DAISY Consortium has created Ace, a command line tool for checking the accessibility of EPUBs - it outputs a report in the form of a mini website. It would be interesting to see if we could run this tool on EPUB ingest and have a link to the report in the dashboard and/or have a button to run the tool from the dashboard view of a specific monograph that has an EPUB. Open to suggestions on how best to implement and automate use of this tool, or whether or not this is a good idea. More info at    Sample report available at 
Ideas from discussion with Apex:   - Embed ACE score into book metadata (like a confidence score) - Display to end user, make it filterable - For transparency - Allow users to request accessibility uplift so we can prioritize backlist titles
