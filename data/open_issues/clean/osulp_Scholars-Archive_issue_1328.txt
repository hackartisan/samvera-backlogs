Enable use of multiple controlled vocabularies for some fields
Would be useful if could drop a LC URI, etc. into the :other_affiliation field instead of current multi-step process. What about other fields?
 thoughts on this? 
I agree that it's useful, and it's something we talked about early on, but it's not really compatible with our current setup.  
okay. probably something to look forward to for OD2 that SA can then leverage?
