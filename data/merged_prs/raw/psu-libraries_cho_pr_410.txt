Title is Required for Works
Description Title is required for the creation of works. Loops through the data dictionary and looks for the fields with the required attribute and adds the additional aria attribute and the span for the required text. Replaces required_to_publish with required where needed. References ticket: (if any) #373 Why was this necessary? We need at least one identifying field, so that librarians can find unfinished work in a listing of works. Changes Adds aria required attributes for the title input. Adds the requireddesignation to the data dictionary ruby file and the csv. Updates style sheet to add bottom margin to all inputs and make the submissions form look for a required designation and add CSS and required attributes to the field. Uses the label for the block, makes the lable titleized, and adds the critical required span. Updates some tests for the title field to be required and no longer just required to publish. Switches required to publish to required in the fields for change set so that the other change set tests pass without modification. We still want to test for the absence of title. Are there any major changes in this PR that will change the release process? Checklist   i18n enabled  adequate test coverage  accessible interface
