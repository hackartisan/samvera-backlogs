fix hyrax overrides once and for all
this has hounded me for... a really long time.  (see 29f3482, #214) when we override some hyrax functionality, it was causing the CatalogController to load before all of the locales are loaded (we were using calls to I18n.t to provide labels to field configs) which resulted in facets, index fields, and search fields receiving 'translation missing' labels. this was only really happening in the development environment (where the code is reloaded on each request), but grew to be incredibly annoying as class_attributes would get reset to their Hyrax defaults + never go back. the fix (ðŸ¤ž) is sort of a blacklight hack, but solves both this problem and the problem of having to provide the same value for multiple different keys (see config/locales/blacklight.en.yml#L24-L25 for an example of this). when blacklight renders a label (https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/blob/v6.20.0/app/helpers/blacklight/configuration_helper_behavior.rb#L136-L152), it adds the value of field.label to the array of defaults passed to I18n.translate. when this value is a Symbol, I18n.translate will treat it as a key within a locale file. since our hyrax renderer remixes are already searching for blacklight.search.fields.${field}, we'll provide this field and the .translate call should pick it up.
