separating the config directories for qa and qa-new
The old way  config_qa_new was a symbolic link to config_qa and all of the config files that changed between new qa and old qa were named with an "-new" The new way the directories are separate:  config_qa and config_qa_new  and the file names remain the same. This makes it easier to change the files in the config directory, but I just realized this does not document which files have been changed on qa-new server. @jrpatterson @informaticianme based on the lack of documentation I am not sure if this is a good or a bad change...
