Bug/#317 new catalog controller approach
refs #317 This pull request implements changes to the catalog controller so that the search page displays the correct fields.  As it stands, the code works in our development environment, however, fields involving dates are not displayed correctly in the testing environment. We can make fields showing dates appear correctly in the test environment, but we have to remove the type: :date flag in solr_name.  That functionality can be had with this line: config.add_index_field solr_name("date_modified", :stored_sortable), helper_method: :human_readable_date Tests for the date fields exist, but they are prefixed with skip for now. Changes proposed in this pull request:  Add, remove, and reorder fields on the search result page for items to make page similar to scholar.
