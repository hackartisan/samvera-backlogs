Claiming issue DLTP-374 @c4937578c1255177c50942d4882dc417cda14ce0 $ ./script/start-issue DLTP-374 [skip ci] Add list of license options to FAQ page @2803f521e83ce951f7cc496375d1b5c59fdab888 Note: The request mentioned that "there is not a good mechanism to see the work form or any information about the licensing or access rights. Adding this to the FAQs would be useful." I added only license information, as the other information is available under "Getting Started: How do I deposit a work". I believe that this simple change fulfills the need identified. Closing issue DLTP-374 @217817a83ef6e351cd3fc9c02ae1a18abe46d085 $ ./script/close-issue DLTP-374
