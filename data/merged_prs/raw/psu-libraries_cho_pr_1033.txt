Update resources via CSV
Description Updating existing resources from a CSV failed due the lack of a bag. Bags are now ignored during the csv update process and a work's file sets are updated based on the metadata exported from the csv. Connected to #888 Changes   any bag reference during a csv update is considered a "failure" and will be ignored   Csv::Importer now updates contained file sets for each work   Notes We didn't need any new tests because the existing tests were already exercising this part of the code; however, I believe they were passing because the bag was always present. By forcing bag to be a Dry::Monads::Result::Failure if we're doing an update, makes CsvDryRun build file set hashes on the work from the csv. There's also a bit of reliance on file_set_hashes in the importer since this class is also used for agents and potentially other future non-work resources. There might be a more elegant way of handling that, but this seems to do the trick for now.
