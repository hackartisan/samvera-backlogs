Feature/#3 create workgroup
Some notes: It's apparently challenging to test routes and requests for authenticated resources, because it's not straightforward to stub the authentication checks when doing full the stack testing that these test types perform. There's some workarounds, but they didn't work out of the box for me: plataformatec/devise#1670 Okay to write off routing tests and request test from the get-go and rely on our integration and feature tests to touch all these pages? More notes: A lot of the controller tests are waiting around for attributes to be defined. We don't have any yet, so I set these up to remain pending. Final notes: There's probably more that could be done with view tests, but nothing that we wouldn't be undoing once our roles and permissions are in place. Closes #3
