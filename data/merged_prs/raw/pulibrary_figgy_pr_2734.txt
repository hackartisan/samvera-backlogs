Updates the BulkIngestController and BaseResourceController for directories selected with browse-everything
This required some significant adjustments to the browse-everything branch which already integrated support for paginating Google Drive file entries: https://github.com/jrgriffiniii/browse-everything/compare/gdrive-paging-jrgriffiniii-rebased...jrgriffiniii:figgy-issues-1536-jrgriffiniii?expand=1 In order to retain backward compatibility with 1.x releases, this duplicates form fields and parameters passed in the POST request which disambiguate selected files from directories.  Additionally, this also provides a BrowseEverything::Resource class (which might be better suited for the browse-everything branch instead).  Resolves #1536
