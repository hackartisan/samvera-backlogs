Adding failsafe for byebug server
Prior to this change when using docker-sync-stack start then running docker-compose exec rails bundle exec rake routes (or any other bundle exec command in the docker context), the command would fail with the following message: Starting byebug server for remote debugging on port 9876 rake aborted! Errno::EADDRNOTAVAIL: Cannot assign requested address -     bind(2) for "localhost" port 9877 After this change when using docker-sync-stack start then running bundle exec command in the docker context the command would succeed and in the console output I got the following: Starting byebug server for remote debugging on port 9876 Port 9876 already in use. It could be byebug
