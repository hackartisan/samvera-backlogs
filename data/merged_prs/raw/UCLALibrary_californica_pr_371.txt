Always be able to mint ids, even after a crash
This is a fix for a bug in Hyrax where under certain circumstances the minter stops issuing new IDs, preventing new objects from being created. We encounter this sometimes when our ingest process crashes for some reason. See samvera/hyrax#3128 for more details. Connected to #359
