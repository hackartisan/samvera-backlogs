Alleviate travis timeout errors by caching download zips
The recent travis timeouts that I've seen have had to do with downloading the solr files.  I added a cache to the travis config to keep previous downloads to avoid constantly having to re-download the same files. This will alleviate some of the network timeout problems, but it won't fully solve them.  Even after caching the files, I still see some timeout errors from solr_wrapper's fetch_latest_version method.  If we decide we want to eliminate that error, we'll need to explicitly set the solr version in config/solr_wrapper_test.yml (and probably need to similarly set the fedora version in config/fcrepo_wrapper_test.yml).  If we decide to do that in the future, we can submit that as a separate PR.
