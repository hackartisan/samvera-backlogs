More dev perks
More improvements to the dockerized dev environment, including:  a rake donut:seed task that:  creates/migrates the DB creates the collection types creates the default admin set imports the default workflows activates the default workflows sets up and populates the S3 bucket creates a user and makes it an admin (if ADMIN_USER and ADMIN_EMAIL are specified)   a postgres container and the config/database.yaml to use it a workaround for a stupid ActiveRecord behavior that wants to create the test database in dev mode, which doesn't work with our dockerized environment
