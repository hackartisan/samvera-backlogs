 Add workflow and identifier to archival media collection
Adds DraftPublishWorkflow and identifier property to archival media collection. Modifies BagPathValidator to allow nil values so workflow state can be updated. Bag path is a required field, so the user must still enter an initial value in the form. Modifies BagPathValidator to test if a bag path directory actually exists.  Closes #1003 Closes #1004
