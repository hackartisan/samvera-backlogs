Removing unused static pages; refactor existing tests
This addresses #728, but as far as I can tell, the videos aren't there anymore. However, there are some other things that need cleaning up. There are some static pages that aren't used anymore: error_pages and subject_libraries. I can find no links to these pages and they aren't tested anywhere. I've also edited the help page to remove the internal anchor links. The page is too short for them to be effective. I've also removed all of the commented-out html code. The feature tests have been updated to reflect the existing pages.
