Add support for starting all dependencies via Docker compose
Add support for starting all dependencies via Docker compose: b443bc2  Added compose file to create mysql and solr/fedora services. Solr/fedora will use our prebuild seeded image by default for now. Used mariadb for mysql since it avoids a lot of headaches with setup. I still haven't found a way, using existing docker mysql base images, to create a new layer with seed data. We may eventually have to create our own startup scripts using the mariadb stuff as a starting point. For now it seems to work well enough to just reload the schema when restarting docker, so broke this out in the readme as a step to perform when using or not using Docker, and noted that you can skip the db:seed:dev step. Cleaned up the readme a bit. Should be easier to read as step by step instructions Note: The docker-compose likely cannot be used for build atm. Will have to revisit the workflow on this later.
