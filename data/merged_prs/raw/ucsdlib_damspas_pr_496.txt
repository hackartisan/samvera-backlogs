Support multiple docker-compose environments
Fixes #495 Local Checklist   QA-ed locally?  Rebased with master branch?  Configuration updated (if needed)?  Documentation updated (if needed)?  What does this PR do? The work entails the following:  Switching to use Solr from an official Docker container that matches our version in use (5.5) Replacing the old, incorrect solr configuration with what we use in production Creating two docker-compose options for running damspas under docker, see docker/README.md Update circleci to use docker/ci/docker-compose.yml  Why are we doing this? Any context of related work? References #495 Where should a reviewer start? Please look at the docker/README.md file. In particular, if you all can run the dev/docker-compose.yml file and let me know if everything works and passes for you that would be great. If any of the documentation seems lacking, please let me know. Also it may be worth doing a docker system prune as noted in that README if you've been testing the other Docker work so far. It should help ensure you have a clean build environment.  @ucsdlib/developers - please review
