Rollins and frontend fixes
Needs review, particularly for accuracy and internal alignment of department and subfield names, and needs thorough user acceptance testing for school, department and subfield validation. One known issue is storing department names in the js, which creates an extra maintenance burden and a point of potential failure. Some of the feature tests could probably benefit from filling fields out of the sequential order they appear in on the page, additionally, there is a 5-second sleep added to the edit spec solving a timing issue that could possibly be better addressed. Refactoring the front end validation, which has grown complicated due to multiple dynamic and interdependent interactions, might be a good idea.
