Fixed error when click 'All Collections' link. Story #1204
There are 2 parts to this fix:   The hyrax view assumes that the description returned by the presenter is an array (and attempts to call .first on it).  That will cause an error in the case where description is nil.  So I made a change to the SolrDocument#description to return empty array if description is nil to avoid raising an error.   In the case where the Collection does have a description, the presenter/SolrDocument was returning nil.  This is because the Collection model was using an indexer that doesn't index the BasicMetadata.  (We missed a new indexer during our recent hyrax gem upgrades.)
