ProQuest error checking and re-submission
We have been seeing a bug where some ETDs submitted to ProQuest don't have their binary attachments. AFAICT, re-running an export of the same ETD results in a valid export, so there must be some kind of intermittent problem (lag from fedora?). During the building of the export zip file, check to ensure the binary files exist and raise an exception if they don't. This will cause the sidekiq job to fail and re-run until it works. Also, add a rake task to export a specific object, and build in parameters for file transmission to proquest, file cleanup, and re-submission, so we can re-queue the objects that failed and more easily troubleshoot future issues.
