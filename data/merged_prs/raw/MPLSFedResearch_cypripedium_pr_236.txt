UI for creating bags
This adds the ability to create bags from the 'My Works' section of the dashboard. Select the works you want to bag, and then click on the 'Add to Bag' button. You will be redirected to notifications with a notice that you will need to refresh that page for updates on the completion of the bagging. When the bagging is done, you'll get a notification. This commit adds the xray-rails gem as a way to determine what views need to be edited. It also changes the capybara selenium driver to use chrome and updates the travis.yml so that it will install the chrome addon. Connected to #188
