Adds rake tasks to audit the Fedora 3 to Fedora 4 migration
This pull request adds a few rake tasks to audit the migration of objects from Fedora 3 to Fedora 4. The idea is that these tasks will be run after deploying the Fedora 4 code base to production and immediately after the migration of data has been performed. The code to perform the audit issues straight HTTP requests to Fedora 3 and Fedora 4 and bypasses Rubydora and ActiveFedora to make sure we query the Fedora repo as close to the metal as possible. The following Wiki page provides some information on how these rake tasks will be run in production: https://github.com/psu-stewardship/scholarsphere/wiki/Fedora-3-to-Fedora-4-Migration
