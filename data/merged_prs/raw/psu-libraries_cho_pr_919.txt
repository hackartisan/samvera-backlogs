Buttons download representative work & plain text
Description On the Work landing page, add dedicated buttons to download the representative access file and the full plain text. If the work has a thumbnail, these buttons are added in the left column just below the thumbnail; if the work has no thumbnail, there is no left column so the buttons are added above the work's title. The styles need a little love... it would be great if we could do a little flexbox magic and lay the buttons out vertically if there's a thumbnail, and horizontally if not. @mtribone, perhaps you and I could pair on that while @awead is out tomorrow (Thursday). Please note, this functionality works through a new field in the solr document, so you will need to rebuild your solr index to see it. Connected to #482 Changes  Index representative file set id in solr Add new partial for the download buttons. Hack in some new factory traits to make this testable... Adam and I would like to refactor the factories to make this cleaner at some point
