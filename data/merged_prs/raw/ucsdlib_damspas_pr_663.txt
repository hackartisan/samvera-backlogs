RDCP: Sort by system modified date in browse by collection view
Fixes #644 Local Checklist   Tests written and passing locally?  Code style checked?  QA-ed locally?  Rebased with master branch?  Configuration updated (if needed)?  Documentation updated (if needed)?  What does this PR do?  Sorts rdcp browse by collection view by system_modified date descending, with title ascending as a secondary sort parameter Adds tests demonstrating this behavior for RDCP, but not for other units (DLDP) Adds timecop gem to easily support time-sensitive tests, which were relevant for the behavior in this PR Fixed a leaky test unit object that showed up in a failed CI run. This is not completely related, but seems problematic and worth fixing (I worry we have other examples of this..)  Why are we doing this? Any context of related work?
