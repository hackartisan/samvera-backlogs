Generate correct type of random content
Description When generating files for benchmarking works, the content was always binary regardless of what kind of file was created. In cases when the file is a text-type of file, we need to use text content. This generates the same amount of random data per file, but uses text if the file is a text mime-type; otherwise, it's random bytes. Fixes #765
