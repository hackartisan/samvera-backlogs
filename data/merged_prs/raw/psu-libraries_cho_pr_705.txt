Extract text when importing works from bags
Description Extracts text from preservation files that have text-based content and creates an extracted text file in the file set. If the file set already provides an extracted text file, or the preservation file does not have text-based content, then no extraction is performed. Corrects a bug where use type was not being correctly provided on imported works. This enables extracted text content that is given in the bag to be indexed on the file set. Connected to #654 Changes  when creating bags for testing, text content for extracted text files is now generated with ipsum we can now specify fixture files to use in the generated bags we use for testing
