Deployable to spot.curationexperts.com
This capistrano setup follows the guide at https://github.com/curationexperts/ansible-samvera/blob/master/docs/capification.md It makes this application deployable to a server that has been set up via ansible-samvera: https://github.com/curationexperts/ansible-samvera  * Set solr settings via dotenv * Set fedora settings via dotenv * Add host to database setup * Cap deploy for DCE sandbox * Add .env.production to cap deploy * Remove the copy dotenv file step from deploy (ansible-samvera put this in place already)
