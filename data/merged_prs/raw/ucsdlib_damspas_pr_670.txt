vrr: use rails logger for rest-client
It appears there are issues, yet to be determined, with batch processing vrr expirations. This patch attaches the rest-client gem to the Rails logger defined for the application. This will result in logging when API requests are made, hopefully giving us more insight into what may be going wrong. Example output: RestClient.get "no_aeon_api_provided/Requests", "Accept"=>"*/*; q=0.5, application/xml", "Accept-Encoding"=>"gzip, deflate", "X-AEON-API-KEY"=>"no_aeon_key_provided", "content-type"=>"text/json" # => 200 OK |  0 bytes => ""  Local Checklist   Tests written and passing locally?
