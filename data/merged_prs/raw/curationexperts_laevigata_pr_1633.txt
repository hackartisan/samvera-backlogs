Persist primary file across page refresh
The primary files is special case because it needs to be persisted even if a user navigates to Box even if they have not saved the tab. Box files pesist when tabbing around, but not if you navigate away from the page without saving. That is how all of the other tabs function! Primary files are special case. This persists the primary file JSON in localStorage so that if the user moves to Box or to another tab, the primary file remains. This also keeps the Box UI present after a file has been picked so that multiple files can be added. Connected to #1627 Connected to #1618 Contented to #1617
