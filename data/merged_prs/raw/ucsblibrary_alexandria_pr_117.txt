SRU: fix cylinder query
Fixes ALMA-646. From the JIRA ticket: I learned 2 things from submitting this problem to Ex Libris.  1. You can report this type of problem directly to the Developers Forum, at: https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/discussions#!/forum/forums/show/5.page which is what Ex Libris asked me to do 2. The reply I got from the Developers Forum is that the SRU alma.all_for_ui works but you have to remove "http://" from the query otherwise it returns no results: https://ucsb.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/view/sru/01UCSB_INST?version=1.2&operation=searchRetrieve&alma.mms_tagSuppressed=false&maximumRecords=1&startRecord=1&query=(alma.all_for_ui=www.library.ucsb.edu/OBJID/Cylinder*)  cc @chrissyrissmeyer @jenlindner
