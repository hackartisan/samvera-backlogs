transform literals from form in the actor rather than the form
moves the transformation of language-tagged values out of the form and into the actor, via a concern. ran into this while submitting/updating an item via the form, rather than batch ingest. Hyrax::Actors::CreateWithFilesActor#attach_files chokes on serializing the form attributes for AttachFilesToWorkJob (see: https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/blob/b054b77/app/actors/hyrax/actors/create_with_files_actor.rb#L42) this is more convoluted than i'd like, but is the best solution i could come up with: we can't move all of the work into the actor because we need to retain the form concern for the fields to be added to the form. rails edge makes this so much simpler with job serializers, but we're a ways away from that fixes #125
