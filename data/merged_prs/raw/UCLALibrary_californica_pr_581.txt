Strip down actor stack CAL-579 CAL-406
Strip down the actor stack during import to only include the parts we really use. We can refine this after our upcoming meeting about the actor stack. TL;DR: 7.7 seconds / record before, 5.2 seconds / record after, for no reduction in functionality. I'm doing this a little out of planned order because it's also needed for CAL-406 Details: AWS T3.2XL (8 CPUs, 32G RAM) all-in-one All tests performed with the same set of Connell sample data on an empty repository Before changes: ingest_2019-04-24-16-41-56.log:I, [2019-04-24T11:45:48.103034 #20393]  INFO -- : event: finish_import, batch_id: 2, successful_record_count: 30, failed_record_count: 0, elapsed_time: 231.8685333410001, elapsed_time_per_record: 7.72895111136667 After actor stack stripped down: ingest_2019-04-24-17-29-53.log:I, [2019-04-24T12:32:31.418417 #10448]  INFO -- : event: finish_import, batch_id: 3, successful_record_count: 30, failed_record_count: 0, elapsed_time: 157.9365567570003, elapsed_time_per_record: 5.26455189190001
