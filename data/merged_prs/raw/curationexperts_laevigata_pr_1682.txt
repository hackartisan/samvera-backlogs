Do not allow unauthorized users to load edit form
Previously, unauthenticated users could load an edit form, but they couldn't submit it. This adds an extra layer of security to ensure that unauthenticated users who attempt to load an edit form for an in progress ETD are redirected to the main page. Authenticated users who attempt to load an edit form that isn't theirs were already getting an "Unauthorized" message, and this behavior has been left the same. Authenticated users who attempt to load an edit form for a nonexistent in progress ETD are also redirected to the main page to prevent exceptions being thrown. Fixes #1639
