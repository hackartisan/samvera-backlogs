Implement the User Interface for CSV Import
Description Improve and implement the UI workflow for importing a CSV file based on a wireframe. References ticket: (if any) #236 #235 Why was this necessary? Admin users would like to import works via a CSV file because it is easier and matches their workflow when wanting to import many things. Changes Putting dry run results into a table with status messages for good stuff and works with errors. Created a partial for the errors to loop through each error message for the import. Added some Bootstrap styles and moved the caption text into a header element. Fixes rubocop errors, makes the form inline, moves the cancel into the form, adds header to CSV Import start page. Added new nav action in the catalog controller for CSV import, added partial for the link, and added i18n for the text. Clean up CSV import views Change button text to Preview Import Show Import and Errors in the status section of the table Display Errors in an unorderd list Add cancel button Disable perform Button if there are Errors Add Counts to Top of Headers for Number of Imports and Number of Errors Clean Up Import Table Link or Button in the UI to get to Import process Added feature test for CSV import workflow Co-authored-by: Carolyn Cole cam156@psu.edu Co-authored-by: Adam Wead amsterdamos@gmail.com Checklist   i18n enabled  adequate test coverage  accessible interface
