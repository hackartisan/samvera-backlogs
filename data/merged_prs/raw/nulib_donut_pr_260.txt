validate edtf format for date_created and index display value
Fixes: nulib/next-generation-repository#342  validates (batch and UI) that there is at least one date_created value present, and that the values are in edtf format indexes the humanized/display version as date_created_display_tesim for use by the front end/UI  Notes: This is affected by this bug: nulib/next-generation-repository#486 where you receive an error if you try to correct and resubmit a failed validation in the UI. We're not sure yet whether this is a Hyrax or Donut bug. Until we can address this, the workaround is to make sure you get the format correct first time around. Batch should work fine.
