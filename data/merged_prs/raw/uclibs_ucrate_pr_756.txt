Adds support for DataCite JSON API.
Fixes #599  ; refs #755 EZID is shutting down service to non California based institutions which made it necessary to transition to another DOI provider.  Several changes were made to the Scholar application but our fork of hydra-remote_identifier also contains changes that were necessary for the migration. This revision replicates the functionality that is present on production, here are some known issues that we should follow up with:  When a work is embargoed and has a minted DOI, the DOI's status does not get updated from registered to published. When a work is updated, the metadata in our provider is not updated.  We also ran into a problem where identifier_url in the database was still pointing at the EZID service, this is tracked with issue #755 and has been resolved.
