ensure that collections from config have permission_templates
i think the reason we weren't able to add items to some collections, or change the permissions on some, is because they were being created without permission_templates. need to deploy to dev + double-check, but i think this should fix that. okay, so it wasn't exactly that, but adding that code shouldn't hurt. the problem was in Spot::Forms::CollectionForm.model_attributes, where the hyrax fields, by being excluded from the .singular_fields attribute, were being converted into arrays on submit. thankfully, this shouldn't need a complete reset of the repository contents, just a deploy. closes #203
