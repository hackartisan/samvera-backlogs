Updating from CurationConcerns to Hyrax
updated Gemfile /CurationConcerns/Hyrax/g, db:migrate, main page loads rubocop  Pinned AF to 11.6.1 Hyrax 2.alpha was causing the models to break due to an active-triples error: “ActiveTriples::UndefinedPropertyError: The property date_published is not defined on class 'Monograph::GeneratedResourceSchema'” This was happening for all the model defined predicates (not Hyrax predicates like has_model though) So instead trying Hyrax 1.0.0.rc2 Migrated minter_state to the database per release notes All model tests now pass  controller specs pass form specs pass lib/importer specs pass presenter specs pass view and route specs pass rebasing to master fixes, fixing a deprecation wip: fixing things by breaking other things i18n is not playing well with everything... leaflet/iiif working for assets All tests are green and some clean up migrated a spec to hyrax changed css, moved downloads controller, added favicon route Migrated some specs to hyrax
