Added a new value for the visibility of a work. Story #608
You can now set a value of "discovery" for the visibility of a Work or FileSet.  The intention is that when we display records with "discovery"-level access in Ursus, the user will be able to see the record's metadata, but not the attached files or images.   The hydra-access-controls and blacklight-access_controls gems already have the concept of "discovery"-level access, but that level of visibility seems to be disabled/unused in the hyrax gem.  This code re-enables that existing visibility level for Californica records.  This will allow us to use the blacklight-access_controls gem to enforce proper visibility in Ursus.   I added the Discoverable module to override the visibility from the hydra-access-controls gem and allow us to add a new value.  This module is included in the Work, ChildWork, and FileSet classes.   I overrode the visibility method in the SolrDocument class to be able to properly display the new value in the UI.   Added specs for SolrDocument to make sure that the new visibility doesn't interfere with Hyrax's lease and embargo behavior.   I copied some form partials from Hyrax to add the new visibility into the edit forms. _form_visibility_component.html.erb and _form_permission.html.erb   Out of scope:  Setting "discovery" access in a lease or embargo.  We can add that functionality in the future if it is ever needed in Californica.
