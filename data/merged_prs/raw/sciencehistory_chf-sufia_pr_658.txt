A CHF::Env class that we will access infrastructure/environmental config from.
This pulls from the config/local_env.yml if it's present. BUT it lets you override that with actual ENV -- awfully useful for testing in dev to make sure it works how you want in different setings. Also useful if we want to deploy the app to another environment like heroku that actually uses ENV. And it also lets you set a default value, including as a lambda using other env or config, for us to set our default dev values, or calculate values that aren't yet in our local_env.yml as independent values. The actual implementation of CHF::Env is a bit hacky, although not too complicated, but I think the API/semantics are pretty good and should be pretty stable. In addition, this PR then uses the new CHF::Env for:  public_riiif_url setting riiif file cache paths, with the defaults that we want (there is also clear riiif file caches rake task) turning on routing of riiif/app paths with defaults that will still route everything in dev or if otherwise unset, but route only the right things if service_level is properly set.
