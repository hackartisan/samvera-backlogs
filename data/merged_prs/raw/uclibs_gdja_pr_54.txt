Fixes #50 More detailed description, if necessary. Try to be as descriptive as you can: even if you think that the PR content is obvious, it may not be obvious to others. Include tracebacks if helpful, and be sure to call out any bits of the PR that may be work-in-progress. Description can have multiple paragraphs and you can use code examples inside: class PostsController   def index     respond_with Post.limit(10)   end end Changes proposed in this pull request: * * *
