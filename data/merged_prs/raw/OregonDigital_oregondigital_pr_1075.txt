Feature/better docker
Most important fixes:  Docker will never accidentally put your local sqlite databases into an image Sets up a more generic Dockerfile for building a "base" image using the latest master checkout of the code.  This should be closer to what we'd want in a production environment. Reorders some of the docker instructions to minimize the costs of the more frequent changes. Test and dev now use a simple sub-image of the od1 base image which installs dev and test gems.  Changes to things like the app code will no longer result in having to rebundle gems. The phantomjs image no longer auto-builds in order to avoid unexpected wastes of time.  Instead, devs will want to pull it before doing work to ensure they have access to the binary. Several issues with the set content linking have been fixed. Compose files are updated to mount the entire local directory structure for development and testing so the latest code is always in use without needing an image rebuild On first run of the dev image, the database and an admin user are created automatically Test containers are stopped after tests run, rather than eating up CPU/RAM forever The above is true unless tests are run with --quick, which allows one to keep containers up and running to make the dev-test loop faster
