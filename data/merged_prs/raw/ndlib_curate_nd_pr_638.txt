ORCID v2.0 update
These changes should prepare us for ORCID's API update from v1.2 to v2.0. Summary of changes:  Pulled the orcid gem controllers/views/services into curate and removed the dependency on the gem The v2 search has changed drastically and will require a bit more work than we expected. We've also decided to drop the input form, in favor of the button that gets the user's orcid from the API. The two methods were confusing, and with the create/connect method the user at least has to authenticate with ORCID as some form of proof that it is their id. Given these two factors, we also dropped the search functionality for now. Moved the logic for requesting the users id and auth token using an auth code out of the CreateProfileController into the orcid module.  Also made a few additional bug fixes/improvements:  Changed the create method in CreateProfileController controller to handle cases when something goes wrong with either the request for the auth token or if the user has denied access to the application, and give feedback to the user via a flash Changed the create/connect link to open within current window, since this will redirect back to this page when done  Related tickets: DLTP-1041, DLTP-1090, DLTP-1091
