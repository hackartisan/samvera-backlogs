Dockerize curate-jetty
Dockerize curate-jetty. This will replace the rake task to run curatend:jetty:start. 6defd83  Added a Dockerfile to reconstruct the necessary version of java, jetty, solr configs, etc Updated the Readme with alternate instructions for running jetty via docker and rebuilding the image .dockerignore will ignore locally installed gems (if you used bundle install --path vendor/bundle). This is to keep the build relatively fast. This will likely need to change if we also use Docker for the rails app  Add additional Docker commands and other Readme improvements b98bb63  Changed the docker run to use a container name and run as a daemon Added commands to stop the docker container Changed the default rails command to use SSL Bonus! Added command for seeding database
