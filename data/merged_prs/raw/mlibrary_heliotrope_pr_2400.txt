HELIO-2659 Add hook to auto-register FileSet DOIs sometimes
If the Press is set up to auto-generate DOIs. If we are going from Private to Public If we are not updating/adding any file_sets If the Monograph already has a DOI Then: create DOIs for the FileSet  Does the above seem ok? We only want to trigger this under very specific circumstances. This also removed the actor_insert code out of config/initializers due to autoload not working right in dev, see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/autoloading_and_reloading_constants.html#autoloading-and-initializers Tested this on staging (the branch is there now) and the actors load correctly and crossref submission happens successfully (if the Press is set to, if there's a monograph.doi, if there are no file_set create/updates and if the monograph is going from Draft to Public (ie: is being "Published")). There's no crossref polling set up yet, that's HELIO-2768
