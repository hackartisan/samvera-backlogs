Modify permissions to allow for anonymous downloading of geo files
Allows geo thumbnails and external metadata to be anonymously downloaded regardless of the visibility of the parent resource. Allows geo files (shapefiles, raster datasets, scanned map tiffs) to be anonymously downloaded when the parent resource is open (public). Reorganizes and partially alphabetizes methods in Ability class.  Because of the way CanCanCan works in conjunction with Figgy; allowing anonymous downloading for different files on a file set required adding an attribute to the FileWithMetadata struct to hold the parent file set id Closes #1025
