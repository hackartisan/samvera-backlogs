Rename file sets during upload errors, ref #974 & #969
ImportUrlJob will fail if the file's url has expired, or if there is some other kind of error during its retrieval, such as a timeout or other disruption. Instead of letting the job fail and having Resque capture the error, we can have the job capture the error and rename the file set to the kind of error. The benefit is that it surfaces the error to the user so that they can take action: delete the file set and try again. The drawback is that it's still creating the resource in Fedora. Ideally, perhaps, we ought to capture these errors even before the file set is created and attached to the work. However, that would require deeper changes to the stack.
