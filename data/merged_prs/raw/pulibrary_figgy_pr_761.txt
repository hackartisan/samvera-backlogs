Refactor schemas
This is my proposal to close #339. It's not drastic at all. It pretty much keeps the prior design, but combines a lot of the schemas and deletes others that were not in use. The reason I kept some schemas I did:  common is used from decorators to delegate attributes to the imported metadata object. geo and iiif are all referenced from decorators to include / exclude their properties in various attribute lists. there are SO MANY marc relators and I think the usual use case would be to use them all at once; encapsulating them this way will reduce noise.  So in these cases there were compelling reasons to keep them separate / DRY. Please argue if you disagree.
