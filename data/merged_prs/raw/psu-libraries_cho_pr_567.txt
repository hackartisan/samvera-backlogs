Add use type URIs to Work::File
Description Connects to #512 This doesn't define a schema for Work::File resources, but instead provides an internal controlled vocabulary for what use types we can assign to the file. I'm totally satisfied with it. I've provided a Work::FileChangeSet to provided better feedback for errors with file, but we're not using it yet. I imagine it will be needed for later tickets when reporting errors with file sets during the bag import process. Also, there is duplication of validation between the file resource and its change set. This is so the existing change set persister can save files correctly, with a default preservation use type. This will also need to change later as we will want to pass specific use types to the persister. Changes Are there any major changes in this PR that will change the release process? No. Checklist   i18n enabled  adequate test coverage  accessible interface
