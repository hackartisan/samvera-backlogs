Implement changes to static page line lengths
Fixes #672 After going through several resources to see what the recommended length for a line is, I ended up following the guide here: https://webaim.org/techniques/textlayout/#column_width, however it is often recommended to be smaller but it looked rather ridiculous at some of the recommended sizing. I ended up testing a few variations of a fix, but settled on using a bootstrap col sizing as it is less intrusive than a custom CSS class, and can be easily changed at a later date.
