Redirect to user's collections dashboard upon delete, ref #740
When deleting your collection, the application was redirecting back to the catalog page. This was not consistent with other delete behaviors that redirected back to the appropriate dashboard page. When a collection is deleted, whether successfully or not, it redirect back to the collections dashboard page with the appropriate message.
