We're hitting GA quota limits on monograph_catalog pages.
Should have seen this coming. We need to come up with a way to cache GA pageview (and other) stats. This PR checks if we've hit the GA quota (it just catches the exception actually) for monograph_catalog and file_set pageview and creates a log entry if we're over the limit: E, [2016-11-17T11:13:07.463486 #6259] ERROR -- : Quota Error: profileId ga:126363248 has exceeded the daily request limit. On the monograph_catalog page, no pageview info is shown. On the file_set stats tab pageview shows as 0, although we haven't seen any quota problems with file_sets yet so it might not happen We need to make a new story or two to come up with a better more sustainable way to show GA stats.
