Claiming issue DLTP-1308 @3963e4bb5c63010eefe1a09f5c8d97cfa15ff584 $ ./script/start-issue DLTP-1308 [skip ci] Deactivate download links without permission @b47c17419b1953064d703ce41442be61ed597bf2 Makes file name and thumbnail text/image only when user doesn't have download (i.e. read) access to the generic file. Previously, when a user didn't have read permission for a generic file, the download button wasn't present, but the download links were still active from the file name and thumbnail, and would redirect to an unauthorized page. Verify authority on representative @db81f81ada594d71931f74836a24516db94edcc3 If user doesn't have read authority, don't allow the representative image to link to the download path.
