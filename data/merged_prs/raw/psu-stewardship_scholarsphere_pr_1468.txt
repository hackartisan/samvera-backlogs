Convenience rake tasks for starting/stopping filestore
Description Rake tasks that start and stop the Python HTTP server that's used for serving out remotely-stored files. Examples bundle exec rake filestore:start bundle exec rake filestore:stop  Writes any output to log/filestore_development.log. You can also start a separate server for test: bundle exec rake filestore:start RAILS_ENV=test  However, you don't have to, and if you specify the same port in the REPOSITORY_FILESTORE_HOST of your application.yml, then you'll only need one server running. Results for both development and test processes will be written to the same log file.
