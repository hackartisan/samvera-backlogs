Sections become FileSet metadata
Renamed the 'section' property to 'section_title' since that's what existing UI code expects.  Also refactored some specs to use the new propery   Make rubocop happy   Updated some specs to use the new FileSet#section_title property instead of Section#title   Rake task to migrate existing prod data   Added test cases for ordered_section_titles method   Deleted much of the Section-related code   Added TODO notes to rake tasks to remove Section code   file_sets need to be reindexed after Section removal so that monograph_id is in their index   reverse migrating FileSets, verification tasks Filesets are reversed on Sections' ordered members, so we want to undo that as we move them to the monograph. The rake tasks are a simple checks to be run before/after the Section removal task.   importer is updated for sections as metadata   don't show section_title in the file_set list of the monograph catalog page   This is work related to #731
