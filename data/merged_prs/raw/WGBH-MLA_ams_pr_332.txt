Fixes deployment
Add options to shebang of install.sh  -l ensures correct environment (namely RVM) is loaded. -e ensures script exits when any command exits with non-zero. This makes for better logging, and fewer false positives.   Ensure bundler is installed before running bundle install. Fixes verify_service.sh script run by CodeDeploy's ValidateService hook. It's now a minimal script that calls 2 rake tasks which check that Sidekiq is running and that the web app is reachable. No longer relies on Sidekiq pid file. Fixes generation of deployment info page. Uses a rails generator now. Deployment info now accessible at /deployment
