Make active form tab agree with content
Fixes #409 Bootstrap js tabs can get out of sync with their content. Sometimes links with anchors are not acknowledged by the nav and won't show the correct tab as active. I added a small script to watch for changes to the anchor and and click correct tab when a change is detected.
