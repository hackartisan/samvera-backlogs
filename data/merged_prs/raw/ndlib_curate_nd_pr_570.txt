Dltp 695 failure to enforce embargo on s
Claiming issue DLTP-695 @c731d608d59bba7dd299d6bfe2a13822cac30e49 $ ./script/start-issue DLTP-695 [skip ci] Relying on an already loaded SOLR object @fd00a4d82dc6b9337975e5855c8fabac8db1082a Instead of loading the object multiple times from SOLR, I'm preferring to instead load_instance_from_solr once. Consolidating embargo logic on Ability tests @50ac57e01a0722cc849c4c5dc64370522c55e00e There are two things going on:  The documentation does not reflect the reality (i.e. SOLR queries did not enforce embargo permissions) There was a heavy duplication of code between testing read or edit permissions.  This commit resolves this by creating a single end point method for the two axis of permission checks on a fedora object:  Fedora or SOLR Read or Edit  Now there is a single method that embodies the permission checking for embargo.
