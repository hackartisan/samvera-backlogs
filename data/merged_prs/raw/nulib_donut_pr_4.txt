Add roles and update README
Run bundle install and rake db:migrate to test locally. A few steps to add yourself as an admin user (also in the README):  Sign in to the app at http://devbox.library.northwestern.edu/ In a terminal run rake generate_roles Then run rake add_admin_role (this uses User.last which will likely be you b/c first step) That's it you're an admin!
