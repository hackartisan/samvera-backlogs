Ingest OSF Project UI
This adds the UI needed to create an ingest job that will (eventually) import data from an OSF project. Summary of changes:  Created a new model to encapsulate the properties of the request. The model has no associated database entity as this will just be passed through to the batch ingest system. Created a controller to handle requests for ingesting new projects and showing existing ingest jobs. The new form uses existing partials such as the administrative unit form. I modified this to allow rendering as a required input, so this change will affect other views and should be QA'd with this in mind. It does not actually add the job to the batch ingest system. For now, the creation and querying of OSF jobs is mocked out in the IngestOSFTools service class. This part of the code path may be rewritten or moved to another service class as part of DLTP-584.
