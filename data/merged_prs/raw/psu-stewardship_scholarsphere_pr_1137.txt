Batch edit: setting embargo and lease, ref #1045
Setting an embargo or lease via batch edit would fail. This enables the setting/overriding of visibilities, embargoes, and leases in batch edit mode by relying on the actor stack to perform the same actions on each work in the batch, as would normally be done if the work was updated alone. When the works have existing embargoes or leases, and a different one is supplied, the newer simply overwrites the existing one. If the visibility is change, the embargo or lease is expired. This may result in a slight amount of information loss because the history message will use the embargoed or leased visibility, and not the actual visibility value specified in the batch update.
