This ticket evolved into the integration of Checkpoint into Heliotrope.  For further insights read/edit the confluence document Devise/CanCan VS Keycard/Checkpoint (https://tools.lib.umich.edu/confluence/x/wgXrAg). Basically this PR lays the foundation for using Checkpoint to authorize access to resources in Heliotrope.  The logical next step is to integrate Vizier (https://tools.lib.umich.edu/jira/browse/HELIO-1863).
