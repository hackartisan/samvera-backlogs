upgrade active_fedora to 11.5.2
From 11.1.6 To upgrade activefedora we also had to upgrade other dependencies, so as to be compatible. This is to get a version of active-fedora which fixes this bug: samvera/hyrax#2108 Which seems to be responsible for this bad behavior in our app: #1105 It's a mystery why we didn't run into this active-fedora bug until now, but this does seem to fix it. However, upgrading active-fedora required upgrading faraday, which made some automated tests fail around our "OPAC Service" scraping functionality. There was a comment note from @hackmastera saying it would, although it's mysterious why. I believe we do not actually use that functionality anymore, and can probably just remove those tests and/or all the code behind that feature. Alternately we could make it work again.
