Fix Chrome testing issues in Travis
Description Updates the webdriver gem and Travis configs to use xvfb during Chrome browser-based tests. Headless options are removed, as full Chrome window will open upon testing. Follows the instructions outlined in https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/gui-and-headless-browsers/ for enabling xvfb for tests that require a GUI. This may make running the locally break, as the version of Chrome you have installed could affect the success or failure of the test.
