Remove "Person" from "Type of Work" facet
DLTP-1259: Remove people from "Type of Work" facet filter: 164c0e3  There did not seem to be a favorable way to do this via supported blacklight methods, at least not on this version. Removing these values from the facets in the solr response also did not work. Ex: even if the solr response for a query had an empty array in facet_counts.facet_fields, it would still show these facets. It appears blacklight reads from the response.docs and finds all values that match faceted fields in the config, instead of relying only on the facet_counts.facet_fields. Instead, had to fix this on the render side by overriding the item values that were sent to the rendered partial. Also had to override the default get_facet_pagination method from the blacklight gem. This is used when you click "Show more" for a filter to show a paginated set of facet values
