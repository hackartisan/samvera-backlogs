Add VRR to damspas
This is all the work from Notch8 to implement VRR in damspas. Additionally, it replaces NewRelic with Honecomb. New things of particular note are:  Database migrations to support Work Authorizations Custom auth using email unique IDs that map to the work authorizations Whenever gem for the hourly cron tasks  The unbelievably massive number of commits is quite unfortunate. That said, the majority of the new code is in lib/processors, the model for work authorization in app/models/work_authorization and the AEON MVC's in app/{models|views|controllers}/aeon This has been running on staging for some months now, which is the best 'real' testing we can get. @ucsdlib/developers - please review and let me know if you have any concerns. At this point, it's probably best to just get this in, and make adjustments going forward if/when needed.
