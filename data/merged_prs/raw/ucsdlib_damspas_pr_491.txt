Invalidate old circleci cache
Previously we were using a different image and I believe the cache is stuck on that old image, resulting in build errors. Bumping/changing our cache name. Local Checklist   Rebased with master branch?  What does this PR do? It removes/invalidates the old cache that was stuck as being owned by root. Instead we'll now have a new cache built that, once merged into develop should clear this problem going forward. Why are we doing this? Any context of related work? Currently we have to 'rebuild without cache' for each build, which sucks @ucsdlib/developers - please review
