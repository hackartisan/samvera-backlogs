vrr: fix id assignment in revoke_old
The existing code was setting params.aeon_id instead of params.id, which ultimately results in a failing submission to the AEON API in Aeon::Request.update_status, which expects the current object to have an id field Also fixed up the new test, which should really be using an equality comparison rather than the object comparison.
