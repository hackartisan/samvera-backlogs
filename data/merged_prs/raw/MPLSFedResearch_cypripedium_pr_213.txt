Initial models for bagging
This commit contains a Bag and BulkBag class that are used for creating individual bags and for creating multiple bags from an array of ids. The bags that are generated by Bag are tar files. This is because they will eventually need to be downloaded/transferred. tar files are less complex than zip files and don't compress files. We don't need compression because the Work contents is going to be binary data (PDFs and images). DPN and APTrust both require tarred bags. https://wiki.aptrust.org/Bagging_specifications https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DPNC/BagIt+Specification++OLD These will be used in a rake task in later work so that they can be used from the command line.
