Upgraded hyrax gem.  Connected to #195
I followed the instructions in the "Upgrade Notes" of this release. As part of the instructions, I ran the generator to generate the database migrations: https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/releases/tag/v2.1.0   In hyrax, some of the views have changed, which caused spec/features/bag_notification_spec.rb to fail.  To fix the spec, I deleted app/views/hyrax/my/_search_header.html.erb from this codebase, and added the bagit export button to app/views/hyrax/my/works/_batch_actions.html.erb instead.   In the ContentDM importer, I added the default collection type whenever a new Collection record is created (to fix failing specs in spec/lib/contentdm/importer_spec.rb).   Moved human-readable type from models to locale file to fix: DEPRECATION WARNING: human_readable_type= is deprecated and will be removed from a future release (human_readable_type is deprecated. Set the i18n key for activefedora.models.#{model_name.i18n_key} instead. This will be removed in Hyrax 3).
