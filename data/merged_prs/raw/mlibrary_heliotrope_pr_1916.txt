add message for HEB users that provides a link to the book on DLXS
Resolves HELIO-1900 Presents HEB users on the monograph page with a message and links to 1) the book on the legacy platform and 2) the accessibility/usability google form to collect information from users if they are having trouble using the new platform. Because the links to DLXS are constructed using the HEB ID stored in the multi-value :identifier field (which also contains the old HEB handles) there was a little bit of work on the monograph_presenter needed in order to find and use the right HEB ID to construct the links.
