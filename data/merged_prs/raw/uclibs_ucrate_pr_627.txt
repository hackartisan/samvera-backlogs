#588 [Part A] Enhances collections export feature 
Refs #588   Re-enables collection export buttons.  Re-enables tests for presence of collection export buttons.  Adds missing fields to the metadata_export_map.  Fixes column headers on collection exports page.  Displays timestamps in local, readable time.  Disables Turbolinks to allow for file download.  Names exportable file .tsv for compatibillity with Microsoft Office + Libre Office.  Nests route under dashboard.  Alters tests to look for Collection Exports page under new dashboard route.  Tests generated CSV's validity.  Supports export of subcollections and works with subworks  The enhanced collection export plays nice with most odd ball cases, if you attempt to export a collection with no works, it works.  If you export a collection with works that are part of a sub collection that is part of the parent collection, we add it a second time in the export.  We'll need to think about how to handle this when round tripping.
