Adding in dry-transactions for creating updating and deleting a file
Description Fixes #551 @awead  @mtribone and I have been looking at how dry-transactions could fit into the system. We included the gem and added classes (no implementation), and configuration for how it might work.  Let us know if this seems reasonable and we will try to hook it into the file creation process in the existing system. The very basic idea is that you have Transactions in the system that you can choose from in your configuration for what you want to occur when a file is created, updated, and deleted.  Each transaction is a dry-transaction, which is a series of operations.  Operations cab be reused between Transactions and we could have different Transactions for different work types. Changes Adds a basic set of dry-transactions operations for a file. Are there any major changes in this PR that will change the release process?
