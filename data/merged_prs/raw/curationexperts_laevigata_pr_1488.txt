Update permission/visibility badges for custom embargo visibilities
We have extended Etd#visibility to support various embargo levels as distinct visibilities. By default, Hyrax treats all items under embargo as needing an Embargo permission badge, whatever the actual visibility under embargo is. The object's SolrDocument#visibility reflects this visibility transformation. To support display of badges for custom embargo level visibilities, we update SolrDocument to derive its visibility from VisibilityTranslator, we then use the EtdPermissionBadge class to generate badges in the EtdPresenter. Connected to #1208.
