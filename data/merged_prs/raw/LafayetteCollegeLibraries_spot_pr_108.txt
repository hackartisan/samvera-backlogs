Parse date_uploaded from newspapers
A small subset of our Newspaper collection have two values for dc:date: one that will map to Publication#date_issued and one that indicates the date of previous ingestion. As it turns out, there's no way to set this value with attributes in the ActorStack (in stock Hyrax): the BaseActor class sets the value to the current time in UTC on create (see: base_actor.rb#L63-L65). This updates the PublicationActor to allow a value to be passed via attributes. Note: we'll probably need to move this to a concern for other work types that have a previous ingest date. closes #103
