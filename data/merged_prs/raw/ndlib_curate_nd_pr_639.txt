Fixity report
This adds a basic report interface that can be used to show the Bendo fixity checks. Summary of changes:  Created a view using Vue for data bindings, sort behaviors, etc. The resulting json from bendo will be rendered as a stringified json into the view, the client will handle rendering all of this as html. Created route/controller path to render the new view. Started adding a json response as well and will likely change the view to primarily fetch data from the controller like an api, but stopping this for the moment just to get this in as it is functional/good enough. Created a service class to handle api calls to bendo's fixity resource. The service requires a bendo_api_key either in the env or in the config. Added this as a placeholder to the dev section in application.yml, but this means I'll also need to create a corresponding change to the secrets before we can deploy. Added active support to the fast spec helper for usage of .present? Added css for rendering sort arrows in a table  Associated tickets: DLTP-1046, DLTP-1095, DLTP-1096
