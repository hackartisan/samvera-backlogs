Claiming issue DLTP-1014 @76bfbb8a45bfa337df5b082cee96a74dedbebc7c $ ./script/start-issue DLTP-1014 [skip ci] Moving index logic from Blacklight to Catalog @911a31365ca40e8c326a391f2d863efcb2dd5e18 I wanted to be explicit about what code existed. There is already a /catalog.json route. This is "adequate" but needs to be further enhanced Adding catalog controller handling of JSON-LD @743981a2ce2f3507f55e98431986a046df93c49c This is the first rudimentary pass at fulfilling DLTP-1014 Normalizing as_jsonld to behave like to_jsonld @d6870ee2ace1106a01defaf8a841241325dfc5ef By switching the catalog to render the as_jsonld JSON document directly, I'm avoiding converting the JSON document to Ruby then converting the Ruby Hash back to a JSON document. Simplifying JSON-LD hash generation @848345e7cded6881e5a177756611c27760225138 There is no need to use the RDF::Graph to generate the JSON-LD. I can instead hand craft it. I included the dump to ntriples to help provide a clearer understanding of how the JSON-LD output will be interpreted.
