Checks to see if Asset exists before ingesting
If the Asset being ingested is already in Fedora, then it will raise an exception that will be caught in the BatchItemProcessingJob's rescue_from block, where the error msg it saved on the BatchItem instance. Also,  Creates a custom error class for AAPB::BatchIngest::RecordExists. Adds a spec for ApplicationHelper#display_date, which failed to get added a while ago for reasons unknown.  Closes #333.
