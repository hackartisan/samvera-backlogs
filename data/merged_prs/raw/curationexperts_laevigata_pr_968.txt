enabling partnering agency in editing
This commit makes the partnering agency inputs load when the edit form loads, rather than only upon selecting Rollins from the school select. There is also some minor js refactoring, a new Rollins edit spec, a check for correct partnering display in the create spec, and re-naming a few scenarios in specs for better clarity.
