Dltp 1518 allow editors to create links
Issue https://jira.library.nd.edu/browse/DLTP-1518 Temporary Access Tokens  Allow creation of tokens by anyone with edit rights, via a link from each work's page. Combine show view for access token into edit views. Remove show view. Add alternate views of access token list, limited to only the tokens someone is allowed to manage, and optionally all of the tokens for one file ID. Fix ability logic for token manager (it didn't actually work before!) Add edit-checking to creation of tokens and customize error messages. Add token list option to "manage" menu. Add option for Token Manager to remove all expired or out-dated access tokens  Admin menu changes  Replace errbit link with sentry link on admin menu. Moved token list off of admin menu (and onto manage menu instead).  Requests for Access  Allows for more than just ETD's to show the access request option, based on content of access_request_map.yml file. This is a first step toward a future option to allow access requests based on a metadata field on a work.
