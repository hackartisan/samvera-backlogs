Merge member of collection ids field into data dictionary
Description The member_of_collection_ids property was defined on works, but could not be controlled using the data dictionary. This adds the field to the data dictionary enabling the same UI elements such as "required." Now, the field will be report as required the same way other fields that are also defined as required. Changes Valkyrie::ID field type Defines a new data dictionary field type specifically for values that are Valkyrie ids. This can be re-used for any relationship between two different resources. Assigning validations Using the validations defined in the data dictionary, assign the methods used to validate each of the properties. This is also includes a new validation method, resource_exists, to validate that a Valkyrie resource exists before using its id as the value of the field. See issue #672 for future work on reconciling the existing validation factory methods with this approach. Collections controlled vocabulary A controlled vocabulary for available collections is used in the UI to allow the user to assign either a library or archival collection to the work. Collection membership is no longer multiple A work's collection membership is no longer multiple. This decision was largely to do the fact that enabling the data dictionary field to be multiple was complicating things. Having it be singular was simpler, but it also solved the future problem of home collections. Works must be part of one principle collection. Additional collections could be in a different field.
