Fixes broken Travis builds
We were getting errors that the version of ChromeDriver was incompatible with the version of Chrome that Travis was running. After much debugging, we found that a recently released version of Chrome was not compatible with the 'trusty' Linux distribution that our Travis CI config was specifying. We upgraded our Linux distribution from trusty to xenial, but in so doing, our Travis configuration for JDK oraclejdk8 became incompatible. Upgrading the distribution from trusty to xenial then caused an issue with running oraclejdk8 (required by Fedora and Solr), because xenial is incompatible with oraclejdk8. We changed our JDK config to use openjdk11 and changed how we start xvfb, from calling an init.d script, to using Travis config services option. This seems to have caused a lot of Java errors as Travis was booting up the test suite, but the tests ran to completion and passed. The Java errors should be investigated further, but should not block this PR as we need to get builds passing again quicly. We also added --fail-fast and format --docuemntation options to .rspec. Going to leave these in for now, but may want to remove them later if they prove to be more annoying than useful.
