Import Description.contents & Description.abstract CSVs to summary
Some DLCS collections use the fields "Description.contents" and/or "Description.abstract" We want to map this to the Samvera field Summary. These CSV columns should import to the property "summary" in californica.   When I import a collection CSV that has data in the  Description.contents and/or the Description.abstract column    Then the data is saved to the "Summary" (summary) field.
