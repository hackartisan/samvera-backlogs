Repair Group Editor and Viewer Permanency
DLTP-1408 : Could not remove Group Viewers from an object, and Group Editor and Groups Viewer could not be removed if they were the same Group.   Group Viewer issue was related to calling the wrong variable to be deleted. This would delete the "Metadata" entry annd leave "RELS_EXT" data to still include Group Viewer and bring it back on next edit. Fixing Variable fixed "RELS_EXT" data   Group Editor issue was caused by a similar problem: "RELS_EXT" data allowed for editor and viewer to be the same, whereas "Metadata" does not. Adding a duplicate check for the "RELS_EXT" fixed the issue.
