GenericFile (now GenericWork and FileSet) thumbnail_spec.rb
Replaced the tests for GenericFile thumbnail with tests for GenericWork and FileSet thumbnails. Notice that with Sufia 7 we don't generate a thumbnail for the GenericWorks, but instead we pick one from the FileSet. In Sufia 7 we generate thumbnails at the FileSet level. I am not replicating some of the tests that we were doing for different kind of files at the GenericFile level in Sufia 6 since those tests are now covered in CurationConcerns https://github.com/projecthydra-labs/curation_concerns/blob/master/spec/models/curation_concerns/file_set/derivatives_spec.rb
