DLTP-1261: Paginate associated files
DLTP-1261: Paginate associated files 9b7c783  Added seed data for an article with many files. This meant expanding the seeds a bit to create classes and methods that would allow us to generate seed data more easily. Added a new method CurationConcern::WithGenericFiles#generic_files_page. This method will get a paginated result set of generic files from solr, and return both the solr response and the datastreams for the files from fedora. There didn't seem to be a natural way to do this via the built associations, so had to recreate a lot of the query/object massaging that happens in other places to get it to work with our Kaminari paginator. Added pagination render to the related_files partial and changed the call from generic_files (which is added via ActiveFedora has_many association) to the new paginated method Incidentally found a problem with how deploy runs seeds. Was looking at current path instead of release path, which means it would not use new seeds if the seeds.rb had been updated as part of this deploy.
