Saves EssenceTracks in batch PBCore XML ingest
Modifies PBCoreXMLItemIngester to save EssenceTrack records for PhysicalInstantiations and DigitalInstantiations. NOTE: EssenceTrack PBCore metadata for DigitalInstantiations is mapped within the DigitalInstantiationActor, but for Physical Instantiations, it's mapped using the PBCoreXMLMapper within the PBCoreXMLItemIngester, and each Essence Tracks is added one at a time to it's parent. Also,  Includes slight refactor of PBCoreXMLItemIngester. Fixes cardinality issue with aspect ratio in Essence Track records; was multiple, should be single-valued. Fixes mapping of PBCore xml annotations; was mapping to 'annotations' but should map to 'annotation' Fixes bug in factories re: date formats; was generating hh::mm::ss:xyz but should be hh::mm::ss.xyz (seconds use decimal for fractions, not a colon).
