Fix regression in role ordering
The previous implementation was not deleting roles that start with a capital letter, which was an omission on my part. I've now inlined each condition and explicitly display the partial and delete the relationship as it is found (lowercase, capitalized). I will also separately raise the issue of why these role values are not normalized. Ideally we shouldn't have to check for capitalization inconsistency.
