Adding hydra derivatives to extract text
Description Refactors the create file into it's own transaction so it can be reused to store the extracted tex.  Then adds a transaction for extracting text. Note:  HydraDerivatives relies on the ActiveFedora::Solr connection, which is why I had to include a fedora configuration file.  I do not love this... Connected to #652 Why was this necessary? Changes  Refactored FileSet Create process so the file create could be reused Created transactions to extract text for a FileSet Configuration for fedora and solr.yml needed for hydra derivatives  Are there any major changes in this PR that will change the release process?
