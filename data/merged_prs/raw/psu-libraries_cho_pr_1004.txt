Setting access rights in CSV
Description Adds support for setting access rights in a CSV when adding new works to a collection. Access rights is added to the data dictionary as a special kind of property that is linked to a Repository::AccessLevel. Setting the kind of access right will trigger behaviors such as limiting a resource (collection or work) to registered or private users. Connected to #976 Changes  adding access_rights to data dictionary Add radio_button field type used only for access rights at this time Adding validation and controlled vocabularies Replace access_level with access_rights where appropriate Making config changes to dev and prod data dictionaries  Caveats The access_rights property is tightly coupled with the repository access level concept, and functions will not work as expected unless this coupling is maintained. For example, changing access_rights to a different name would break these features. Future enhancements could make this coupling more transparent or flexible.
