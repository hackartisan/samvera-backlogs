Implement a read-only mode
Connected to #462 Creates a read-only mode for Californica which creates a safe window during which backups can be performed. When californica is in read-only mode it can still be searched and ursus will will be able to read from californica, but no changes can be made.  There is a feature flipper that will turn the read only mode on and off    When read-only mode is in effect there is a banner telling Users why they can't add or edit records    Changes to be committed:  modified:   app/controllers/application_controller.rb new file:   config/features.rb new file:   spec/features/read_only_mode_spec.rb
