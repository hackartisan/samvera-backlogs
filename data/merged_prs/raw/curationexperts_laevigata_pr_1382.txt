Add `VisibilityTranslator` as alternate collaborator for `#visibility`
We want to extend Etd#visibility to provide new visibility levels:  VisibilityTranslator::FILES_EMBARGOED: indicates that the work is under embargo, but that it is discoverable (not restricted/private). FileSets that are members of the work should be under a parallel embargo, making tthem private until the embargo end date. VisibilityTranslator::TOC_EMBARGOED: indicates that the work is under embargo, as described above, and that the table of contents should be suppressed for the duration of the embargo. VisibilityTranslator::ALL_EMBARGOED: indicates that the work is under embargo, as described above, and that the table of contents and abstract should be suppressed for the duration of the embargo.  This adds a VisibilityTranslator interface and base implementation (as described above) that can be used as a replacement for the default #visibility method on any Hydra::AccessControl::Visibility object. Objects implementing this interface are intended to be injected as collaborators to allow swappable #visibility implementations. The end goal of this work is to allow administrators and approvers to edit existing embargoes. This requires being able to select an appropriate visibility as the "during embargo" and "after embargo" values at edit time. Connected to #1206.
