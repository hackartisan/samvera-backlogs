Enabling private access
Description Restricts collections to the users who have created them by adding a "system creator" attribute to the collection. The attribute is not present in the data dictionary but can be added to any collection or resource. The system creator is always a member of read users, to ensure they have access to the resource. Additional changes were made to enforce read access rights defined in a collection's access level. Note: Edit rights are not controlled. This will be dealt with in a later ticket. Connected to #975 Changes  refactored transactions into AccessControls module updated transactions to make changes to access control attributes access control attributes added change sets default system user or current user is assigned to all new resources
