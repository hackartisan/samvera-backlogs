Hide modal dialog boxes on page load
Even though the modal dialog windows were marked as ARIA hidden the form controls were still accessible. On the record show view this caused a problem because form controls on the modal window overlapped with site navigation elements. The JavaScript sets explicit in-line styles to show or hide the modal dialog when it is activated/deactivated. This fixes #192
