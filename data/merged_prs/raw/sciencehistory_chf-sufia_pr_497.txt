Change 'In generic work' label, and don't show on empty.
I am not a huge fan of how I did either of these things either -- I just like this intervention better than anything else I could come up with, which was even awfuller, and would involve overriding larger parts of sufia/CC and risking forwards compat problems, or making the code even more confusing and harder to find what was going on. I am thinking when we overhaul the 'show' page generally, I'd like to just override the actual show template, and stop using some parts of the sufia/cc/hyrax abstraction architecture which are over-engineered and hard to work with without actually providing customization hooks we need to do what we needed here.
