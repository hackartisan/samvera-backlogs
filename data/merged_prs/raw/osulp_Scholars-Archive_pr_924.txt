update hyrax gem and applied new migrations
Updated hyrax gem to v2.0.0.beta3 pre-release. According to the release notes https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/releases/tag/v2.0.0.beta4, there are updates for file-related actors that could potentially fix the duplicate file issue #914 Applied new migrations coming from hyrax rails hyrax:install:migrations as suggested in the release notes Updated ScholarsArchive::OtherOptionCreateSuccessService, so that it inherits from Hyrax::AbstractMessageService instead of Hyrax::MessageUserService, which was removed in this new hyrax release Re-created gemfile.lock (without affecting other updates coming from hyrax, see commit e7cd482) specifically for the shoulda-matchers gem that was causing circle ci to fail on bundle install. This solution was suggested in thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers#1057
