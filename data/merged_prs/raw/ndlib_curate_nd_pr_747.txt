Ensuring expanded ToS allows acceptance
Ensuring expanded ToS allows acceptance 49767a7 Prior to this commit, the HTML modal was rendering inside the form. This would work, except that the modal JS would pull that HTML and render the DOM elements outside of the form. This resulted in a loss of the form context, and thus the submit buttons didn't know where to submit the accept or decline action. By moving the modal content outside of the form, and adding a form around the submit buttons:  the expected behavior is restored we don't violate HTML standards by having a form nested within another form  In addition, I've added a confirmation flash message to let the end user know that the ToS was accepted.
