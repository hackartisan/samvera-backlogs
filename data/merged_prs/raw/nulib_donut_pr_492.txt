[Security] Bump rubyzip from 1.2.2 to 1.3.0
Bumps rubyzip from 1.2.2 to 1.3.0. This update includes a security fix.  Vulnerabilities fixed Sourced from The Ruby Advisory Database.  Denial of Service in rubyzip ("zip bombs") In Rubyzip before 1.3.0, a crafted ZIP file can bypass application checks on ZIP entry sizes because data about the uncompressed size can be spoofed. This allows attackers to cause a denial of service (disk consumption). Patched versions: >= 1.3.0 Unaffected versions: none    Release notes Sourced from rubyzip's releases.  v1.3.0 Security  Add validate_entry_sizes option so that callers can trust an entry's reported size when using extract #403  This option defaults to false for backward compatibility in this release, but you are strongly encouraged to set it to true. It will default to true in rubyzip 2.0.    New Feature  Add add_stored method to simplify adding entries without compression #366  Tooling / Documentation  Add more gem metadata links #402  v1.2.4  Do not rewrite zip files opened with open_buffer that have not changed #360  Tooling / Documentation  Update example_recursive.rb in README #397 Hold CI at trusty for now, automatically pick the latest ruby patch version, use rbx-4 and hold jruby at 9.1 #399  v1.2.3  Allow tilde in zip entry names #391 (fixes regression in 1.2.2 from #376) Support frozen string literals in more files #390 Require pathname explicitly #388 (fixes regression in 1.2.2 from #376)  Tooling / Documentation:  CI updates #392, #394  Bump supported ruby versions and add 2.6 JRuby failures are no longer ignored (reverts #375 / part of #371)   Add changelog entry that was missing for last release #387 Comment cleanup #385  Since the GitHub release information for 1.2.2 is missing, I will also include it here: 1.2.2 NB: This release drops support for extracting symlinks, because there was no clear way to support this securely.

Fix CVE-2018-1000544 #376 / #371 Fix NoMethodError: undefined method `glob' #363 Fix handling of stored files (i.e. files not using compression) with general purpose bit 3 set #358 Fix close on StringIO-backed zip file #353 Add Zip.force_entry_names_encoding option #340 Update rubocop, apply auto-fixes, and fix regressions caused by said auto-fixes #332, #355 Save temporary files to temporary directory (rather than current directory) #325  Tooling / Documentation:  ...
