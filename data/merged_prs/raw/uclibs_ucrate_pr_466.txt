Implement autocomplete on specific new work form fields
Fixes #367 Modifies several partials in the app/views/records/edit_fields folder to have the attribute autocomplete="on" for several fields in create work forms. The fields changed are:  Advisor College Program or Department Publisher Subject Geo Subject Time Period Language  The Author and Creator fields are already pre-populated from the database, so they did not need to have autocomplete turned on (https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/wiki/Autocomplete-in-Hyrax) Note: Since these fields are currently multi-value, I simplified the partials to only be multi-valued. If this changes in the future, you can change it by comparing it to the default partial in the hyrax-editor gem under hydra-editor-4.0.2/app/views/records/edit_fields/_default.html.erb.
