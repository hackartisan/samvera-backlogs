Add rspec-retry gem and fix batch_edit_spec
Partial fix for #310 spec/features/batch_edit_spec.rb:85 has been failing pretty frequently.  Samvera folks added a wait: 5 to the test, but it doesn't seem to be enough.  Sometimes the batch takes a long time to save and the test gives up.  Increasing the wait to 1 minute helps some, but we don't want to always wait that long. So I added the rspec-retry gem that lets us configure certain test to automatically run again and give them another chance to pass.  I've configured spec/features/batch_edit_spec.rb:85 to try running 3 times before giving up.  After running it locally and on Travis many times, that spec has always passed.  So this should get rid of false failures for that test.
