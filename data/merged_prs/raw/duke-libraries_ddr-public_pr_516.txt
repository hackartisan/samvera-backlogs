Add support for isFormatOf item relationships
For a regular shared facet value relationship (such as series values as used by Duke Chapel) use the first configuration. For an ID pointer relationship add the id_field to the item_relators configuration (will be used for Radio Haiti). In this example the isFormatOf field will reference the arks of any related items in the permanent_id field. item_relators:   - name: "Related Items"     field:       - :series_facet       - :facetable   - name: "Other Versions"     field:       - :isFormatOf       - :symbol     id_field:       - :permanent_id       - :stored_sortable
