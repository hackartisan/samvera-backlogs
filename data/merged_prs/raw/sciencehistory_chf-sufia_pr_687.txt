App will use images on show page from riiif or hydra-derivative 'jpeg' depending on config
To accomplish, also refactored _show_page_image image tag generation to a unified member_image_tag helper. Which will make it easier to do the GA stuff in #668 Currently defaults to using riiif. If we don't want to use riiif, we could change the default, or just add a key in local_env.yml, use_image_server_on_show_page: false  You can experiment in dev to see both modes by starting up as: USE_IMAGE_SERVER_ON_SHOW_PAGE=false rails server USE_IMAGE_SERVER_ON_SHOW_PAGE=true rails server  Closes #686
