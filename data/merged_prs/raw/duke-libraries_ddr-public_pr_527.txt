Structural metadata upgrade
This is a first pass at both (1) adding a model and support for the new structural metadata format so that ddr-public can make convenient use of structural metadata and (2) supporting backward compatibility with legacy structural metadata methods to ease the transition/migration. The new Structures class delegates the following methods to SolrDocument: derivative_ids, multires_image_file_paths, first_multires_image_file_path, and ordered_component_docs. In the future I might decide to deprecate or remove these methods in favor of using the structures model more directly. For now, they provide backwards compatibility and limit the changes needed to the code during the transition. Going forward, here's how structural metadata may be accessed using the Structure class from a SolrDocument. Currently the flat default structure, and the grouped images and files structures are supported (note that I'm calling this method "files" because "document" is used to refer to solr documents in Blacklight). I can imagine a "nested" type being added in the future to support directory structures. Sample console interaction with a SolrDocument item with a flat/default structure: > solr_doc = SolrDocument.find('changeme:554')  => #<SolrDocument id="changeme:554">  > solr_doc.structures.default  => [{:doc=>#<SolrDocument id="changeme:607">, :label=>nil, :order=>"1"}, {:doc=>#<SolrDocument id="changeme:608">, :label=>nil, :order=>"2"}, {:doc=>#<SolrDocument id="changeme:609">, :label=>nil, :order=>"3"}, {:doc=>#<SolrDocument id="changeme:610">, :label=>nil, :order=>"4"}]  Sample console interaction with a SolrDocument item with a grouped/images and files structure: > solr_doc = SolrDocument.find('changeme:1021')  => #<SolrDocument id="changeme:1021">  > solr_doc.structures.images  => [{:doc=>#<SolrDocument id="changeme:1030">, :label=>nil, :order=>"1"}, {:doc=>#<SolrDocument id="changeme:1031">, :label=>nil, :order=>"2"}, {:doc=>#<SolrDocument id="changeme:1032">, :label=>nil, :order=>"3"}]  > solr_doc.structures.files  => [{:doc=>#<SolrDocument id="changeme:1029">, :label=>"Sermon", :order=>"1"}]  I'll add this note to the jira issue as well.
