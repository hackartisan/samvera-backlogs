Collection and Work migration
I putting this out for comment early.  The work is not complete, but I want to be certain I have broken things up in a logical fashion.  (not just logical to me) The CreatorMigrator is the main class that calls all the rest to migrate the creators for both Collections and Works. The SolrListMigrator and the CreatorList are still only partially implemented since we do not have the Alias PR merged.  The CreatorList will convert all the creator Strings to Aliases using the AliasManagementService once that is included into develop.  The SolrListMigrator will use the new Aliases to convert the string creators currently in the system for each object to pointers to Aliases. LocalUserLookup is a helper class to identify creators as local users to link or create them with the PSU login information. SolrObjectlist, SolrWorkList and SolrCollectionList loads all the object ids from solr and then loads each item from fedora as we iterate through the ids.  The idea is to save on memory since Collection.all or GenericWork.all loads all objects into memory when only one is needed at a time.
