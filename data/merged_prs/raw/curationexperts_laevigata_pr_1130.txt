Story 1029: Display config for schools
The configured relationships between schools, departments, subfields, admin sets, approving users, and workflows is complicated.  That information is spread across a dozen yaml files and 5 or 10 database tables.  It's really hard to understand the current configuration for a running app. This code attempts to make it easier to understand the config by displaying the full config on a single web page for each school. Some things to note:   I made a SchoolsController to display the config info for each school, which is only accessible by admin users.   I pulled the logic for choosing the correct AdminSet into a new class AdminSetChooser, so that I could share that logic between the Etd class and the School and Department classes.   I copied app/views/hyrax/dashboard/sidebar/_configuration.html.erb over from hyrax so that I could insert the nav link for the schools config page.   Connected to #1029
