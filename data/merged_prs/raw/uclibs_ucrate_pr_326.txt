Update spec for deleting non-empty collection types
Partial fix for #310 The test https://github.com/uclibs/ucrate/blob/develop/spec/features/collection_type_spec.rb#L376-L408 was failing very frequently.  I determined that it always failed when it ran after https://github.com/uclibs/ucrate/blob/develop/spec/features/collection_multi_membership_spec.rb#L99-L113 It turns out the test had some problems and was only passing sometimes for the wrong reasons.  The test incorrectly tried twice to delete a collection type.  That problem had since been fixed in the Hyrax version of collection_type_spec.rb.  So I updated our collection_type_spec.rb to match https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/blob/v2.1.0/spec/features/collection_type_spec.rb#L366-L390 You can replicate the failure on the develop branch by running bundle exec rspec ./spec/features/collection_multi_membership_spec.rb[1:2:2:1:1] ./spec/features/collection_type_spec.rb[1:4:2:1] --seed 17037 If you then switch to this branch and run the same two tests again, you shouldn't get any failures.
