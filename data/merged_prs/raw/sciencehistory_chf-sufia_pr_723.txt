inline rights_statement in _chf_download_menu
This did have significant perf impact. Turning it into a helper instead of a partial had the same perf impact, if we wanted to keep DRY. But I think this was a false DRY in the first place, it really IS a different thing, the code is actually cleaner with it being separate, with it's completely own CSS class, trying to override the CSS for the 'large' rights statement didn't make a lot of sense or make the CSS easier to deal with. (The CSS here is still kind of a mess, but only trying to fix what's relevant for the perf improvement here. writing maintainable CSS is not something I'm great at yet.) Note that all the actual heavy-lifting is done by calls to the presenters anyway (which then call out to CHF::RightsStatement in turn).  There was just no good reason for the additional layer of indirection/DRY in the first place, this is an all around code improvement even aside from perf I think. This does make me consider turning the OTHER two partials into helper methods though, to see how that effects perf. I think we're down to perf being rails issues alone no longer sufia/samvera-related. rails is just slow at: 1) partials, and 2) generating URLs via routing. (riiif branch may generate more urls than master or certainly than stock sufia)
