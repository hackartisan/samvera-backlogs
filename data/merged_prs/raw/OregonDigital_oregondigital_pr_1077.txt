Fetch methods for ITIS and uBio, Scientific controlled vocab
Fixes #1017 Fixes #1018 Fixes #1019 Updated ITIS URI and prefix. Added scientificNameAuthorship predicate. Drop 'www' from uBio URI config and vocab class. Reordered scientific fields to match hierarchy. Changed prefix of ITIS to be 'https'. New Scientific controlled vocab and custom fetch Create a new Scientific controlled vocabulary for all of the scientific name fields. This will pass on fetch calls for ITIS or uBio URLs to lib/oregon_digital/rdf/controlled which has the new custom fetch methods. Add a Species field.
