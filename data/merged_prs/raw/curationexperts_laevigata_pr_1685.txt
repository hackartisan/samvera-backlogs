Handle 1.x style visibility settings
In Laevigata 1.x, many objects have their embargo type set with "true" (a String) instead of true (a Boolean). When determining visibility, we need to take this into account. I can't figure out how to write a test for this because in Laevigata 2.x it is impossible to create an object with these mis-matched visibility settings (as it should be). Fixes #1681
