Remove SpellCheck Solr component
Fixes #463 Local Checklist   Tests written and passing locally?  Code style checked?  QA-ed locally?  Rebased with develop branch?  Configuration updated (if needed)?  Documentation updated (if needed)?  What does this PR do? Removes the SpellCheck configuration and related references and tests from damspas. Why are we doing this? Any context of related work? References #issuenumber Approved by Products Group Our current implementation of the SpellCheck component has the following issues:  It is slow. According to our NewRelic benchmarking, the SpellCheck portion of our Solr queries takes 90+% of the query time in Solr. It isn't effective. The quality of results returned from the SpellCheck component are suspect, to say the least. So we're losing a lot of query performance for something that provides essentially no value. This can, and should, be revisited for dams5  Where should a reviewer start? The spellcheck related code removed from catalog controller's index method, primarily. The rest is mostly cleanup to ensure tests still pass that needed to be there. If I made any mistakes, it's probably there, thanks in advance!
