Accessible Form Updates and i18n
Fixes #378 and #373 Description Running through the interface to swap hard coded text with i18n translations and reworked the collection form for better accessibility. Refactors labels and inputs surrounded with paragraph tags and hard coded breaks with fieldset, legends for organizing form controls into a group for users of accessible technology. Also adds required to title for both the label and the input. Why was this necessary? In order to populate text changes in the UI throughout the system easily, we are converting things like titles, labels, buttons, etc. to i18n to have consistent text and easier updates. Also to target some accessibility errors. We need to have at least one field required, so that librarians can find work in progress in the UI. Changes Uses the existing i18n for the collections from the dropdown menu for the headers on the forms for collections. Updates the collection form to use better accessibility practices, adds i18n translation, and some form styles. Form fields are now grouped with fieldsets for better organization. Are there any major changes in this PR that will change the release process? Nope. Checklist   i18n enabled  adequate test coverage  accessible interface
