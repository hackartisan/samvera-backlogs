Fix - Edit page fails to render visibility badge in dev (not on servers)
Connected to CAL-713 Edit page failed to render visibility badge in dev (not on servers) The work edit page failed to render due to an error related to the "discovery"-level visibility badge. This happened only in development, not in production. That's because this line was invoked in production:                californica/config/initializers/hyrax.rb                    Line 13       in       a6e251a                                                     discovery: "label-info"                     But per this discussion: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8895103/how-can-i-keep-my-initializer-configuration-from-being-lost-in-development-mode it ran once in development but then reset on subsequent requests.
