Create a from using Vue and a state object
This commit changes the submission form so that it is generated with a Vue single file component: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html All of the html, css, and JS for the form is currently in the the app.vue file, which is rendered in the new.html.erb view for in_progress_etds. The form is generated from form_schema.js which is based on the terms that returned by Hyrax::EtdForm.terms. Eventually this object should be able to handle the possible states of the form. This also includes changes to the .travis.yml so that the yarn dependencies are installed correctly during the test build.
