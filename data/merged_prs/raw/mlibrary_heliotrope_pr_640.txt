Resolves #599: Updating the file of an existing file_set should work …
…in riiif and leaflet   Override Riif::Image.cache_key to include the file_set's timestamp when caching image tiles. If the file/image changes, then the old cache_keys will no longer work and new ones will be generated. The cache is cleaned periodically via a rake task and cron to clean up these old cache tiles.   When a file is characterized we need to delete riiif's cache of it in tmp/network_files. If it's a new file it won't have one and won't matter.
