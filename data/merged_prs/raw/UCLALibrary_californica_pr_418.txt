Add works to collections at import time
Build test collections the same way Hyrax does Add the collection factories from hyrax so that when we build collection objects we know we're doing it the same way Hyrax does.   Pluralize factory names The FactoryBot / Rails convention is that factory names should be pluralized. We should follow that convention unless we have a strong reason not to.   Use latest darlingtonia This allows us to specify the collection id and the depositor's user_key at ingest time. The collection id will be used to add all works in this ingest batch to that collection, and the depositor's identity will be used to track the ingest job.   Connected to #395
