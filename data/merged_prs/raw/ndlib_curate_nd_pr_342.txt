Department and administrative cleanup
Removing Department class as it is unused @ab6c821f445a65377e132f14bd0b28f8d20f0268 It no longer makes sense as it is not reference throughout the entire CurateND code base. It should have been removed as part of the following commit: @a4262d6d00b680ac8f95f09bfc7e4bc978a51fda  Removing files that are no longer used With the replacement of Organizations with AdministrativeUnits, we no longer need the helper method nor the form partial.  Replacing unneeded method alias @92fbba2afb6dcebcbf053e36ee247035ce89347f Instead of eligible_for_selection? which aliases selectable? which aliases selectable, I'm removing the superfluous eligibile_for_selection? Arranging and tightening up method names @ad9048adad8ab1597c58ed1178422e711644a1f3 This is a very low level refactor preferring alias instead of alias_method (as per a Rubocop suggestion). Also preferring a proper fetch and default value instead of the inferred nil == false. Switching to hierarchy usage of Locabulary @fb8afd68b07048eacb293cb3b1d31a4cc403b617 This does not tidy up the nasty HTML generation that is going on. However it does normalize how we build our hierarchical Locabulary data usage. Closes #336 Removing the freezing of Time via Timecop @27a33e222f997cd59507dd3de48358bdd8c60a6d At one point, temporal control was vital. However that does not appear to be the case.
