Using Code Climate for combined coverage stats
Refactors our travis build configuration to use stages and upload a combined coverage report to Code Climate. Utilizes AWS, Travis's stage build process, and encrypted environment variables to authenticate and upload data. This also refactors the before_script directive in travis.yml to its own actual script that is hopefully easier to read. It also includes some colorized output for better readability in the Travis log:  Detailed documentation can be found on the wiki and in our dltdocs site. I'll post the link to that in private Slack. The result looks like:  Unfortunately, we won't know what the code climate report actually looks like until we merge the PR.
