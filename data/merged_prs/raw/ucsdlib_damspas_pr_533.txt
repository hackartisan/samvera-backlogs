docker: enable debugging with byebug and friends
Fixes #issuenumber Local Checklist   QA-ed locally?  Configuration updated (if needed)?  Documentation updated (if needed)?  What does this PR do? Adds support and documentation for use debuggers like byebug with the docker/compose development environment Why are we doing this? Any context of related work? This is still new territory for us, and I ran across this issue working on a different project last week. So I thought I would document and add the solution that I found here. Where should a reviewer start? See docker/README.md for how this would be used in practice Manual testing steps?  Run a fresh build using the docker/dev/docker-compose.yml file. Add a byebug statement somewhere. Controller, wherever. Run the app and get it to trigger the breakpoint Follow the instructions for using docker attach <container> and try interacting with byebug  @ucsdlib/developers and @orangewolf - please review
