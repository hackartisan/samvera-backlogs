displaying valid tabs and handling mismatch between school and dept
This commit ensures the next tab the user should see is displayed. This is accomplished by storing the currentStep property, which is a record of a valid tab save, and comparing each new currentStep against it in the model. When a user has four valid tabs, and edits the first, and saves it, the 'currentStep' should not become the first tab; we ensure the tab that displays is the fifth in that case. It also handles the case where a user has saved school and department data, and changes their school selection and navigates to the program tab without saving their newly selected school. An error message is displayed next to the Department field and no options are loaded. In a future commit the tab(s) will reflect this messy/dirty state so that students can easily see which tabs are valid (saved) and which tabs have new but unsaved information in them.
