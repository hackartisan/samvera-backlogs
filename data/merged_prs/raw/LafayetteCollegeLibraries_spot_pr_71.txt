add controlled vocabulary support to Publications (and beyond!)
This picks up on some of the work begun in #57, which lets us add support for indexing controlled vocabulary values. The tl;dr is "this adds support for languages to use the LOC ISO-639-1 vocabulary". But it also paves the way for fields outside what's considered "BasicMetadata" in Hyrax. Oh, and I legitimately forgot that this also includes some clean-up of the PublicationIndexer, specifically how identifiers are indexed (tl;dr: they're back to just being indexed as identifier_ssim + the IdentifierController is used for shortcut routing). Still needs tests, some docs, yadda yadda.
