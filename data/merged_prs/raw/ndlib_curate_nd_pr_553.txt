Claiming issue DLTP-599 @5e4fb718a381914d1f4cf855f7d4aedbdd8205a6 $ ./script/start-issue DLTP-599 [skip ci] DLTP-599 Make nd-only thumbnail viewable to public if work is a public work and files are authenticated only @d1834d7e92ee474f5cc44f5ac53b202c4a2e47f7 When actually work is public and generic file is registered, make thumbnail visible. This change will check for parent permission and generic file permission if public did not have permission to view thumbnails. We are granting access only to view thumbnail not the actual file itself. Closing issue DLTP-599 @ce07cfafc834dc0c89a05d217f674ba193bc3a19 $ ./script/close-issue DLTP-599
