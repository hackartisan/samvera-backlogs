Integrate fulcrum.org jekyll pages into the rails application
Closes #373 This PR adds the jekyll site templates for fulcrum.org to a new ./fulcrum directory within heliotrope and builds the site in the ./public directory using a new rake task, bundle exec rake jekyll:build. The jekyll site templates are under version control, but like other jekyll projects the built/output pages in ./public are not. This now means that anytime we want to add a static page to the application, it must be done using the jekyll site. Documentation for this new functionality is at https://github.com/mlibrary/heliotrope/wiki/Static-Pages-and-Blog A couple other notes:   the heliotrope-deploy codebase has also been updated to call the jekyll rake task and build the site during deployment. This call is in /hydra-dev/heliotrope-deploy/config/deploy.rb and has been committed and pushed to the master branch of heliotrope-deploy. In other words, if you try to deploy heliotrope to staging or preview BEFORE merging this PR, you will probably get an error because the jekyll rake task heliotrope-deploy is looking for is not in the codebase yet.   This PR also removes the landing page feature spec. Because we are not tracking the pages built in ./public in github, which are served by the server, we cannot test those pages.   Apologies for not squashing commits, but I'm sick now and don't feel like doing that.
