Collection Landing Page in two Columns without Resources
Description This is a small step in our Collection landing pages tickets. Still using the Blacklight partials and the search context (catalog) to display the show page. However, we have the title of the collection at the top and the description in the first column. Collection metadata goes into the second column. Title and description are duplicated in the metadata output, but will be resolved in future work on the collection landing pages. This paves the way for the representative image, browse button, searching the collection, etc. Connected to #896 Changes  Removes the tools partial from the display to give more room for the two column layout Adds the collection title to an <h1> at the top of the page Grabs the description field contents and displays it under the title in the first column Uses the default Blacklight show partials to outpout the metadata Adds a <h2> for the metadata
