Part of story #1445 - allow student to replace primary file
This code fixes a problem when the student had an existing primary PDF file, and then tried to add a supplemental file, there would be a 404 error. The problem was caused by the fact that the 'uploaded_files' input on the form contained not just the newly-uploaded file record IDs, but also the ID of the previously saved primary PDF.  So when the controller received that extra ID, it would look for the corresponding Hyrax::UploadedFiles record (which doesn't exist). I added a conditional to the hidden 'uploaded_files' input that prevents previously-saved files from being added to the array.  Previously-saved files can be differentiated from newly-uploaded files by the deleteUrl, which contains the model name. Connected to #1445
