Collections index thumbs
A PR into the collections-index branch at #553.  Closes #550. Collection thumbs are just in the source repo under app/assets/images/collections. Once deployed, a collection can use an image by setting it's represensative_image_path to eg toy_dummy_collection.jpg.  A rake task is provided to let you do that conveniently with id to path/filename pairs:  rake chf:collection_images[5h73pw048=toy_dummy_collection.jpg,9p2909328=whatever.jpg]  This is a kind of hacky design, but it was fairly easy, and will get us going. And works reasonably fine in dev/test. A default collection thumb is provided, just some random license-free svg 'archive box' art I found. I assume we wont' stick with this, but we need some default image. (We could make an image of the blocks if we really want to, although the blocks are actually a font-awesome glyph). I also updated the collection#show page to use this representative image, cause it was pretty easy. Couldn't figure out how to update the search results thumb for a collection in a reasonable way (found the partial, but couldn't figure out the presenter), so didn't do that for now.
