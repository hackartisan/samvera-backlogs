Normalizing Articles#attributes partial rendering @65eb187b6e593adb837f170d528496f64a390ab1 To bring the rendering of creator and contributor inline with how we chose to do them for documents, I'm leveraging the curation_concern_attribute_to_html method for standardized rendering. DLTP-486 #comment Normalizing Articles#attribute rendering Routing /concern/articles/:id to /show/:id @564a67b4f05314b8d0ef201cdcae79e1073eda33 As part of DLTP-486, I want to have a common rendering page. This is not yet a completion of that requirement, but addresses the common URL aspect of the requirement. Updating common objects to reflect concern#show @eafd56f613c0d14f4a50507b100b5c0c32817f1c Prior to this commit there was a disparity between the CurationConcern#show page and the CommonObjects#show page. This adjustment brings the common objects inline with the show pages. It will require visiting each of the curation concern types.

Without the "/concern/<curation_concern>/new" route, that URL will redirect to "/show/new" URL. See @13689221 for specific solution.
