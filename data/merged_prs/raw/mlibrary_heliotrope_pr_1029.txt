Fixes #1017 'Read' link for epubs on the press catalog page
Hyrax is appending "locale=lang" to all urls by default, so building urls using raw strings isn't going to work anymore. It also turns out that "subdomin" is a reserved term by the rails url helpers, http://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.1/classes/ActionDispatch/Routing/UrlFor.html#method-i-url_for so we'll use "publisher" as the param name.
