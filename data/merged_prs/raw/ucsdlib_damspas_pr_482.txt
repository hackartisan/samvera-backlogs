Circle and docker
Fixes #481 Local Checklist   QA-ed locally?  Rebased with master branch?  Configuration updated (if needed)?  Documentation updated (if needed)?  What does this PR do? This PR does 2 things.   It updates the CircleCI config file to use the custom damsrepo and postgres Docker images that I've created instead of pontos.   It creates a Docker-based dev/test environment that can be used locally instead of dams-vagrant    It adds a Dockerfile for damspas It adds a set of environment files in /docker It adds a docker-compose.yml file for creating an environment that builds and runs containers for damspas, damsrepo, postgres, and solr  Why are we doing this? Any context of related work? References #481 Where should a reviewer start?  The circleci config file can be reviewed fairly independently of the rest I would look at the changes in the config/ files, as those reflect one of the major changes which is changing the default database for all environments to postgres. Please look at docker/README.md for some notes on how to setup the dev environment. If anyone is up for giving it a try locally that would be great.   Database changes  Changes default database for all environments to postgres  Deployment Instructions  See docker/README.md for local dev setup  @ucsdlib/developers - please review
