rdcp created date sorting (Collections) and last modified date display (Objects)
WIP: please don't merge until @lsitu and I have been able to test this out w/ stakeholders in QA. This PR is up as an FYI for now. Fixes #643 Fixes #644  Note: These are grouped into a single PR (separate commits) because they both depend on a new implementation of created and modified dates as discussed in ucsdlib/damsrepo#92  Local Checklist   Tests written and passing locally?  Code style checked?  QA-ed locally?  Rebased with master branch?  Configuration updated (if needed)?  Documentation updated (if needed)?  What does this PR do?  Sorts by created date for RDCP collections by default Adds a Last Modified Date to the DAMS Object view (only)  Why are we doing this? Any context of related work? References #643 #644 Screenshots Last Modified date on Object view:  @ucsdlib/developers - please review
