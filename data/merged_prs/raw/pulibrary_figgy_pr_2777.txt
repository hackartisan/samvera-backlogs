Add cocoon for nested forms
Adds Cocoon gem for nested forms. Adjust styling to mimic hydra-editor multivalued fields. Makes all nested resource forms a collection.  This is a departure from the existing nested form implementation. This fixes an issue with deleting a nested resource and improves the UI. The place property on numismatic issue is an example of a nested form where users can only add a single set of values. https://github.com/pulibrary/figgy/blob/5a8ac11b673e209ae91fcb50cb412fea5583e554/app/views/numismatic_issues/edit_fields/_place.html.erb This could also be enforced with a validator.
