373 rename editors and viewers to record editors and record viewers
Claiming issue 373 @57c0bc5f456cdd5f1b622063ff5376c331def063 relates to #373 $ ./script/start-issue 373 [skip ci] Renaming editors to record_editors @e3d43913072b64dc4420dfdbca80a6e7e509cbd2 At present we have tremendous potential for confusing method names. There exists editors. This works up until we add metadata regarding an object's editor metadata (i.e. what is the name of a book's editor as identified within the book's pages). Renaming viewers to record_viewers @3ed54b530fc42685cf146bce5db8d10c7a75c995 Building on the rename from editors to record_editors, I want to provide a consistency in prefixing and naming conventions. Renaming editor_groups to record_editor_groups @f5dc1a0843e4293ecbb51a6045435552d23f0c31 Building on the rename from editors to record_editors, I want to provide a consistency in prefixing and naming conventions. Renaming viewer_groups to record_viewer_groups @b9ed93216f7fed1ec58db13598685068c993ea09 Building on the rename from editors to record_editors, I want to provide a consistency in prefixing and naming conventions. Renaming "record" permission modules @5d22ead6a27450467be2b7ffdd2c4b6c44efdf00 Again, building on the shift towards record editors and record viewers, I believe it is helpful to rename the modules to best reflect a consistent meaning.
