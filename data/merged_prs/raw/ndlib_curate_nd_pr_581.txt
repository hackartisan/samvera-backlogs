JSON-LD route generating invalid JSON-LD
Claiming issue DLTP-751 @7fa8caeae3f23196e4a9d38efc719251d5668d84 $ ./script/start-issue DLTP-751 [skip ci] Updating ETD Factory to set degree @7593142f06f841318a21e5b6ac1ec9b1e6624dfb Prior to this commit, the degree values were not being properly set. Generalizing AsJsonldMapper @d272fd96a7ec168ad3a10280bc670fed21a1a4ed Leveraging the RDF library to build the statements for the JSON-LD graph. This involves a change to the DatastreamJsonMapper object. Instead of removing that Mapper, I added an alternate Mapper so I can test the output of that object versus the output of my new object. Addresses DLTP-751 Removing extra iterations from AsJsonldMapper @9b4457e1452025f9df3c4b15464cada0ee19d55b Instead of building an array, and then looping through, consolidated that logic into a single pass. Switching to using the AsJsonldMapper @84e91e437db6a4c2aef058cc04a4a184de7f9ec3 Instead of the predecessor (DatastreamJsonMapper), I'm using the more generalized RDF statement generator. This is a better mechanism for generating JSON-LD documents based on heterogeneous underlying objects. It is not bullet proof but adequate for our needs. Removing DatastreamJsonMapper @75b1a76a55ff4e8cb86732dfd331ce2d4ab2f042 This has been superseded by the more general AsJsonldMapper object.
