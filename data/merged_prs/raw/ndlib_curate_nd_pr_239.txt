Increasing no items found text
Why:  At present the "No entries found" was getting lost in the chatter of the page.  This change addresses the need by:  Increasing the font-size and font-weight of the "no search items" result. Note: This value piggy backs on the paging response for a search query (and not the search result area). In other words, if there are no items in the result set; Instead of rendering a "no items in the result set" section within the search results area, Blacklight renders a "no_items_found" I18n value in the pagination area.  As per the ticket, I'd like to move the result to the left, however, due to the parent container's lack of a modifying class, I can' remove or as easily target and adjust the parent .pager { float: right; } directive. Closes #221
