fields: add more ordered names
Fixes #634 Local Checklist   Tests written and passing locally?  Code style checked?  QA-ed locally?  Rebased with master branch?  Configuration updated (if needed)?  Documentation updated (if needed)?  What does this PR do?  Extract out ordered roles to a YAML file (loaded via an initializer) to make it easier to adjust in the future Add a few additional tests for new roles in the ordered listing Add a few name/role examples to damsProvenanceCollection3.rdf.xml for testing  Why are we doing this? Any context of related work? References #634 - RDCP would like more control over name/role ordering, so hopefully the refactoring work in this ticket of the specified role order to a YAML file will help make any future changes a bit more manageable. @ucsdlib/developers - please review
