WIP: Work show page
Redesign of work show page, per discussion at #535.  Does not have a viewer yet, just the show page. Code is kinda messy in some places. Had to override sufia in some odd ways.  I wanna figure out a way to clean up the CSS at least. Other feedback very welcome. Currently using the derivative(s) that were there, not quite the right resolution(s), defering that until we have riiif. If you wanna take it for a spin, be sure to look at it with and without admin login, it differs somewhat. Will likely squash before merging, these commits are kinda messy, especially at first when I was experimenting a lot.
