Add select2.css directly to the donut application
@kdid @bmquinn @davidschober  This should fix #176 (nulib/next-generation-repository#176) and #177 (nulib/next-generation-repository#177). The problem was that *=require select2 in app/assets/stylesheets/hyrax.scss is not actually pulling the file into the application for whatever reason.  The select2.js file is getting brought in via the select2-rails gem, but it's select2.css dependency was not. So, this solution gets it working by including a hard dependency for select2.cssin Donut.  The right way to fix would be to eventually pull it via the gem, if anyone's feeling ambitious.
