Updates Rubocop and adds Pry for debugging.
Push Rubocop to use Ruby 2.5 syntax. This pushes the admins task, and turning off the frozen string literal changes.   Enable the ABC Size metric, and limit the others that are still off to only the failing files.   The User model had two problems. First, the ABC size was too high, and second, AR's #first_or_create method has been silently unsupported. Switching to #find_or_initialize_by solves the second problem, and using #assign_attributes fixes the first.   Pry can do debugging like byebug, but adds a bunch of convenience. Use binding.pry where you would have used byebug.
