Bump yard from 0.9.18 to 0.9.20
Bumps yard from 0.9.18 to 0.9.20.  Release notes Sourced from yard's releases.  Release v0.9.20  Fix parsing of stringified Symbols in Ruby source (#1256). Fix path traversal vulnerability in yard server. This bug would allow unsanitized HTTP requests to access arbitrary files on the machine of a yard server host under certain conditions. Thanks to CuongMX from Viettel Cyber Security for discovering this vulnerability.  Release v0.9.19  Fixed bug in browser back button (#1071, #1228) Fixed handling of ArgumentError in ExtraFileObject (#1198) Fixed double return tag displaying on boolean methods (#1226) Removed unused Module#namespace_name function (#1229) Fixed parsing order of README files. YARD will now prefer README over README.md over README.x.md or README-x.md (and the like). READMEs will now also be ordered by filename; the first README is still chosen unless --readme is provided. Updated AsciiDoc markup support to use non-deprecated calls.     Changelog Sourced from yard's changelog.  0.9.20 - June 27th, 2019  Fix parsing of stringified Symbols in Ruby source (#1256).
