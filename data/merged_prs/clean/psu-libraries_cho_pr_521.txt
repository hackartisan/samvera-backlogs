Submission change sets should require a collection
Description A submission change change with an empty array of member collections will still be valid. This seems wrong. If works are supposed to always be in a collection, then the submission change set should not be valid if there is not at least one id in the array of member collections. Why was this necessary? This should prevent the occurrence of works without a parent collection. Changes Are there any major changes in this PR that will change the release process? No. Checklist   i18n enabled  adequate test coverage  accessible interface
