AMS2-264 Add Series Collection as a custom collection type
Custom collection types are made by admin users in the UI. However this will only create a custom collection type with some features. But to customize metadata, input forms, and display, code changes are needed.  Updates configuration section of sidebar to bring in updates from Hyrax 2.1.x which adds the link to manage collection types. Adds module for CollectionSeriesMetadata and includes in the Collection model. Overrides methods on Hyrax::Forms::CollectionForm by prepending module CollectionFormOverrides. Prepending happes in an initializer. Adds database seeds with custom Series collection type, and ensures seeds are run for tests. Adds ability for admins to create Collections. Modifies create_series_collection_spec.rb to match the new interface. Modifies :admin_user factory to avoid errors due to duplicate role names. Overrides views from Hyrax to accomodate optional description (as opposed to required description):  app/views/hyrax/dashboard/collections/_list_collections.html.erb app/views/hyrax/collections/_collection_description.html.erb   Removes code pertaining to previous Series model, which was a custom work type.  Also...  Adds  to admin role.
