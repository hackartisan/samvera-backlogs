Improve test suite speed by limiting text extraction
Description By only extracting text from sample file when needed for explicit testing, we can reduce test suite times. Two traits are available to a work, the typical one will add a file but not extract any text or perform other post-processing. The other trait will validate the file as well as extract text. In the future, this will also comprise characterization and derivative creation as well.
