Addressing load issue in Document
Adding an explicit load for the RDF::ND module. In development, I encountered the following error: NameError: uninitialized constant RDF::ND In production this manifested in the Document class not having the correct predicates in it's inspect. If Document were the first of the repository models loaded, then the class would say something like: Document.new.title NoMethodError <#Document> does not respond to :title If Document were loaded after other repository models (e.g Image), then we wouldn't encounter the error, and the Document would have the expected attributes. For workers, since usually load one model at a time, they would always encounter this error. But for web-application facing, they would not, as Document is one amongst many objects that could be loaded. DLTP-1520
