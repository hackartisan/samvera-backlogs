add task to get children from handles manually fixed
Related to #1796 Some works fixed manually have child works that still have unclean creators. My original tasks didn't take into account child works already fixed in #1796 (comment) This tasks gets a json file with handles, including child works that we can analyze "handle-url" => [{   member_id: "ABCDE",    member_creators: {"hello","world"},   member_model: "articles" }]  Update: I'm also adding another task R3 to generate r3_handles.csv of handles with child works that we could run as scholars_archive:migrate_dspace_creator_member_cleanup
