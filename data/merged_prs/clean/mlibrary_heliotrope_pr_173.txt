Initial file metadata
Closes #54. Add custom File Set fields, create Heliotrope::Forms to override FileSetEdit forms, extend file_set_controller behavior to accept custom fields, create test or FileSet creation; update date to date_published in blacklight and en locales and fix a few typos. Once merged, I will file a bug for the issue where the creator field is being overwritten by the uploader e-maill address. Note: This is going to fail the travis-ci build on GH because my spec is relying on redis. If anybody knows how to attach a FileSet to a Monograph via a spec without redis running, please help.
