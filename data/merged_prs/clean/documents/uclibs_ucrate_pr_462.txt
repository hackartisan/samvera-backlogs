Configures facets to display the same as Scholar.
Fixes #245 ; Present short summary (50 characters or less) Configures facets to display the same as in Scholar Tests explicitly expect the facets we want on the page, they also expect exactly 6 facets, instead of explicitly expecting a page not to have facets. This gets around a scenario where the facet name we expect not to be there is present, but not the same display name due to translation or something in that vein.
