Disable right click over video elements
Disabling src attribute on multiple source elements resulted in undesirable behavior -- mainly the video not loading for playback. Instead of removing the src attribute, I've disabled the right click, which is at least something we can show NW to gauge their level of comfort. I would venture to guess that with right-click disabled and no "download" button on the page, we're effectively preventing download for 90-95% of users. There is also a side fix in here that makes the video player responsive and sizes it to the width of the asset column.
