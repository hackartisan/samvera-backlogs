reindex and then delete older records
Records that existed from before the reindex and weren't touched. Ie, records that were deleted in the original store, but still had existed in the index somehow.  DELETE_PREVIOUS=true bundle exec rake chf:reindex   note new option to chf:reindex task, can now delete deleted/not-present records, based on them being records that weren't touched in the reindex.
