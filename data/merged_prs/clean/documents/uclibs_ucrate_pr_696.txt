Implement changes to static page line lengths
Fixes #672 After going through several resources to see what the recommended length for a line is, I ended up following the guide here:  however it is often recommended to be smaller but it looked rather ridiculous at some of the recommended sizing. I ended up testing a few variations of a fix, but settled on using a bootstrap col sizing as it is less intrusive than a custom CSS class, and can be easily changed at a later date. The affected pages are:               Note: This includes both login pages, for local logins and the production login page, since in development it only shows the Local Account Login Page.
