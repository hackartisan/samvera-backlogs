Fixed a problem with access controls in a FileSet record. Part of story 608.
I noticed this problem in the UI: when you change the visibility of a work record, it gives you the option to apply those changes to all the child records.  If you select 'yes' background jobs run to update all the attached FileSet records.  But in some situations the resulting visibility for the FileSets didn't match the parent work. The problem was caused by an assumption in the hydra-access-controls gem that caused it to incorrectly match on some access control records that it was selecting for removal.  Because we are overriding visibility in Californica, that assumption is no longer true.  I'll take a closer look at the hydra-access-controls gem later and decide if we should file a bug against it, but for now, overriding the "permissions_attributes=" method from that gem allows us to fix the invalid assumption. I added a spec for "inherit_permissions_job_spec", which tests the exact problem at a higher level than a unit test would. I added exclusions for this file in rubocop.  Since this method is an override, I want to keep it as similar as possible to how it appears in the gem, so that we can more easily compare the override to the original.
