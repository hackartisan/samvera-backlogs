ChangeSetPersister#delete should update parent resources
Description Parent resources were not updated when their child members were deleted. This fixes that by doing a larger scale change and unifying all the membership methods between Valkyrie resources. All memberships, whether many-to-one or one-to-many, can be found using the member_ids method. This makes the process of delete contained resources and updating their containing resources much easier. Connected to #638 Changes  file_set_ids is changed to member_ids collection membership can also be expressed in ids with member_ids ChangeSetPersister#delete updates containing/parent resources when their members are deleted
