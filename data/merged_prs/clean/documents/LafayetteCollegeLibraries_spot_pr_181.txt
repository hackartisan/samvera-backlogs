Add CAS authentication
wip for now until we hear back from the auth folks, but this gets CAS authentication set-up for users (ðŸŽ‰). when in development, providing an email address for the environment variable DEV_USER will start the server with that user logged in.   install devise_cas_authenticatable  remove (some of) hyrax user attributes  confirm working w/ lafayette cas system  note you're gonna want to squash + merge this because i kinda hecked up the migration ðŸ˜… closes #1
