Ensure XML is valid before importing
This commit adds a validator class that uses a RelaxNG schema to ensure that the XML is valid before importing. The XML must have a <metadata> element with a <collection_name> and then one or more <record> elements. The record elements require a <title> element. This commit also fixes an issue with the method that removes the author string from titles. Before the title would need to have a slash in it because the string was being split on the slash, but now the method will check to see if the title has a slash in it before splitting. This was causing some records to fail when importing the Sargent and Sims collection.
