Allow ordering of alias objects in place of persons, ref #991, #949
This makes two main changes: 1) Creates an Alias resource that stands between a work and its creator; and 2) orders aliases using a membership predicate. Previously, a work would contain one or more Person objects as creators. In order to allow for different names for the same canonical person, an Alias class holds a display name and a reference to a single canonical user. The AliasManagementService is responsible for finding or creating persons and aliases to attach to new or existing works. Forms for works can now accept either new creators or edit existing ones. When new creators are added, both aliases and persons are created as needed, via the AliasManagementService, or if display names are changed, new aliases are added to the existing person, also via the AliasManagementService.
