Fix for DLTP-1247 XSS bug
Fix for DLTP-1247 XSS bug a1c1e15  The placeholder text for the search bar was allowing injection of unsafe code. The splash title is assigned by Catalog::SearchSplashPresenter#call, which is driven by url params. Marking it as html_safe in the view without sanitizing it within the presenter is causing the bug. As far as I can tell there is no reason to mark it safe, and I was unable to trace why this was added, so I'm just going to remove and let rails sanitize it. If this causes a problem we can evaluate how to more safely allow this to be driven by params.
