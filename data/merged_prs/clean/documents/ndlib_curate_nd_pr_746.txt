Refining Doi::Datacite.normalize_identifier
Adding testing tables 2a3e70e Instead of the chatty individual rspec scenarios, compress those into a test tables. This helps clarify at a glance what is being tested. Refining Doi::Datacite.normalize_identifier 64fb24f Based on the following comment in JIRA, the solution is to ensure that past scenarios continue to work when we apply different implementations of the normalize_identifier.  We've seen this before: #201 As noted there, a DOI is not a URL. Also, there appears to be no standard for prefixing DOIs. I think the best normalization routine is to look for the initial "10." in the DOI, strip of everything before and prefix it with "doi:". DOIs in that format seem to resolve ok, since the dx.doi.org resolver can deal with a "doi:" prefix.  DLTP-1528
