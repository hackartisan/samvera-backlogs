Change to allow specifying users by net id when managing groups
Change back-end to allow specifying users by net id 7184add  Changed group_membership_action_parser to implicitly convert a user with a name but no id to a create action. This is to ensure this is passed on to the group_membership_form to create a user before adding to the group Added a new service class that will assist with all of the things involved in creating a new user, including creating a person and profile. Will go back and refactor other things to use this. Changed group_membership_form to create a person and profile if one does not exist for that user name.  DLTP-1459 Frontend changes b9c9fab Changed front-end settings to allow for ldap search of netid Merge pull request #717 from ndlib/DLTP-1459 e31a231 DLTP-1459 Frontend changes DLTP-1387: Integrating front end and back end changes 750d818  Changed the _linked_members.html to be a bit more explicit about the action for each user id. For new users it will now have a _new attribute similar to the _destroy. This removes the ambiguity on the back end inside of the group_membership_action_parser Changed the _linked_members.html form and the link_users.js to additionally pass the full name of the person With these changes, in the case of a 'create' action, the person_id will allways be a netid when it makes it to the group_membership_form. Simplified this code to always call FindOrCreateUser with the given id and name Updated the specs to match these changes and added tests to ensure that the user's full name is mapped appropriately to the user/person/profile fields.
