Document loading db schema in docker dev/test environments
Local Checklist   Code style checked?  QA-ed locally?  Rebased with master branch?  Documentation updated (if needed)?  What does this PR do?  Documents the change to use db:schema:load instead of db:migrate when using Docker for dev/test work. This is not only faster, but also ensures the db/schema.rb file doesn't get updated, which should really only happen when we add new migrations. Documents removing docker volumes along with containers. Updates CircleCI config to use db:schema:load for consistency (and minor speed gain)  Why are we doing this? Any context of related work?  Prevent accidental commits of modified db/schema.rb file. And speed.  Where should a reviewer start?  docker/README.md  Manual testing steps?  Feel free to run this locally and confirm if you're up for it.  /developers - please review
