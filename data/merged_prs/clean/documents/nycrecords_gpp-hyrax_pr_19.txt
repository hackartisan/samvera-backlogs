Feature/GPP-273: Sort Changes
This PR adds Title, Agency, and Date Published sorting options to the search page. When saving to Solr, add an extra entry in the document to save Title, Agency, and Date Published as a SSI (String Stored Indexed). By default the custom form fields are saved as TESIM (Text English Stored Indexed Multivalue). Solr is unable sort metadata that is stored as multivalue so we have to create a single value entry in each document. Additionally we have to change the Date Published format from MM/DD/YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD in order to allow for proper alphanumeric sorting.
