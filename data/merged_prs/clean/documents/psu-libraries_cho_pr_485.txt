Full loop from file to repo
Description Creates works by importing a csv file in the UI, running a dry run, and import. Running this brings up some issues.  How are we getting the files attached to the work? Should this really be a UI element based on question 1? When the same file gets uploaded twice the upload process errors (files are stored on disk with their original file name)  References ticket: (if any) #238 Why was this necessary? Changes  Adds a Importer for the CSV Dry Run Results Adds files to the DRY Run Adds UI elements for running the entire process (very basic)  Are there any major changes in this PR that will change the release process?
