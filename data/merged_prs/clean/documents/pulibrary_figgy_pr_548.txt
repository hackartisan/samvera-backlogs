Implements an indexer for the EphemeraFolders for cases where the folders should be hidden
Resolves #494 by implementing an indexer for the EphemeraFolders supporting the following:   Incomplete Folders (all EphemeraFolders in a state other than complete) within incomplete EphemeraBoxes (this assumes that a Box exists for the Folder, and that it is in a state other than all_in_production) are privately visible  Incomplete Folders without Boxes are private, but restored to their current visibility once in a state of complete  Incomplete Folders are not indexed for discovery within pulibrary/lae-blacklight
