Implement collection relationship wireframes 
Description Builds off of #413 and adds the UI methods to add works to collections and display them in paginated fashion.  References ticket: #383 Why was this necessary? We need the ability to works to collections. Changes This expands and overrides Blacklight a lot in order to display a collection's members in tabular format. I'm not entirely happy with the approach just yet. I borrowed most of it from Figgy and it doesn't have much test coverage yet. I'd like to explore some other options, maybe, before merging this. Are there any major changes in this PR that will change the release process? No Checklist   i18n enabled  adequate test coverage  accessible interface
