Changing Submission to define it should have a Set of Ids for member_of_collections_id
Description This changes the type of the values in the list to ids. This does not really enforce that an id must be used, since Valkyrie::Types:ID take any value in it's constructor and does a to_s on it. In addition we needed to add a default to the definition becuase of a bug in Dry::Types.  Valkyrie 1.0 works around this bug, so upgrading will allow us to remove our default. References ticket: (if any) #415 Why was this necessary? For consistency and documentation to enforce that member_of_collections_ids will actually be Ids. Changes Are there any major changes in this PR that will change the release process? Checklist   i18n enabled  adequate test coverage  accessible interface
