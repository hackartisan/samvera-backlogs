Unpublish on delete, HYACINTH-186
Unpublishing from all publish targets when an item is deleted. I am not sure the tests I added are helpful, but it helped me understand the logic better. I have a feeling that I may be missing something else that needs to happen as part of this process. , let me know if you can think of anything. Should we add something to the delete dialog that says something along the lines of "Deleting this object unpublishes it from all publish targets"?
