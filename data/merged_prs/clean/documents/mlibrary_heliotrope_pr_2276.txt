Resolves HELIO-2514, CSB-206 and CSB-211
Resolves HELIO-2514 in heliotrope Resolves CSB-206 and CSB-211 in cozy-sun-bear This version of CSB updates the scrolling manager to handle pre-paginated volumes, and also sets us up to do hypothes.is integration. In particular: use IntersectionObserver for performance bundle polyfills for IntersectionObserver separate preferences between layouts  This should allow us to stop making .sm.epubs and passing useArchive to CSB for pre-paginated volumes, a practice that was established to deal with performance issues that were experienced in HEB pre paginated EPUBs. I have tested this on heliotrope preview server with both pre-paginated and reflowable EPUBs and across Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Edge and IE 11.
