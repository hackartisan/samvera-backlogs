Sanitize remote file names, ref #727
This problem was introduced in 8094bfb Remotely-uploaded files from BrowseEverything were failing to process because of non-alphanumeric characters in their filenames, such as spaces and parentheses. CarrierWave, which is responsible for uploading local files for ingest, already has a process for sanitizing filenames by removing these unsupported characters. We can fix the remote file problem by using CarrierWave::SanitizedFile to clean remote filenames the same way we are cleaning the local ones. This increases our dependency on CarrierWave, but we're already using it, so this bring both file upload processes closer inline with one another.
