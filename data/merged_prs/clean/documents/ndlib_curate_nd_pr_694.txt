Add additional derived create dates
DLTP-1258: Add additional derived create dates c6696f6  Expanded the derived created date on all models to also convert publication_date and date_issued when they are available, using the priority sequence of publication_date -> date_issued -> date_created. Added some additional attributes to the dev seed data in order to easily test this derived date. Fixed a problem in catalog_controller with the sort field name. Since we're using solr_name helper to determine the full field name, don't need to include the dtsim suffix. Also changed to stored_searchable to add the m to the suffix (to match the way the field is created in the model) Fixed a problem in catalog_controller with the sort function. It must use the ordinal function since it's multivalued. If this because inconsistent or problematic (ex: Solr recommends not using ord() because of high memory usage), then we'll need to modify the schema to be single valued and reindex everything.
