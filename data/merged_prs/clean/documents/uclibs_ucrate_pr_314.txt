Split embargo notify and release tasks into separate namespaces
Partial fix for #310 Coveralls keeps shifting the test coverage for /lib/tasks/embargo_manager.rake depending on the order in which spec/mailers/embargo_mailer_spec.rb and spec/rake/embargo_manager_spec.rb run.  The last one to run wipes out the coverage results for the previous one. The only way I could resolve this was to split the rake embargo_manager:release and rake embargo_manager:notify tasks into separate tasks in their own namespaces.  The new tasks are rake embargo_release and rake embargo_notify. I also increased the test coverage of the embargo_notify task to 100%. There may be more work needed to completely fix Coveralls, but this should take care of the /lib/tasks/embargo_manager.rake problem.
