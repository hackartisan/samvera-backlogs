Updates Solr config and schema
Remove all 'suggest' features. The 'suggest' thing slows things way down, and we think it's also causing stack overflows. NOTE: the Solr config and schema are not used directly from this repo, but are intended to be copied to, and used in, the Solr instance used by AMS.
