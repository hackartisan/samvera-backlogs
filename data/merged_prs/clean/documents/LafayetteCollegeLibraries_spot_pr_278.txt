ui updates
i kinda fast-tracked things on the view front on #273 to focus on getting collection-slugs out the door. this'll be more user-interface-focused updates expanding this to include some of the UI odds + ends that were out of the collections scope.  moves collection related_resource to their own text block updates SolrDocument#to_param to prefer slugs for Collections (when they exist) adds the second navbar (1_column layout) back only display the admin facet block when admin facets exist (previously, the header was just floating there when no facets were available)  todo üêõ   clicking a link to a featured collection does a redirect dance and throws an unauthorized warning? (visiting the URL doesn't send a redirect? wtf)  collection#show sort-by dropdown is showing untranslated keys   closes #283
