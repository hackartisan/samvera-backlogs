Use ScholarsphereLockManager for Redis 2.4 compatibility
This implements a file-based locking mechanism that we use in Archivesphere. I'm testing against Batch, which uses locking in find_or_create. It is also used in Sufia::GenericFile::Actor#add_file_to_collection but I'm not explicitly testing it there. The travis build is passing, but it doesn't use Redis 2.4. To test it against 2.4, you'll need to do that locally. I installed 2.4 on my laptop, and the test suite passes except for two errors in spec/models/migrate_audit_spec.rb. However, if run that entire spec file in isolation, or even the entire set of model spec tests, they all pass. Because the failures only pertain to the migration audit, which we're not using anymore, and aren't reproducible, I'm inclined to say this is acceptable and try regression testing on QA. Thoughts?
