Add Shibboleth support via Keycard
This PR brings an in an update to Keycard and adjusts the Devise binding to use it rather than resolving the HTTP headers itself. There are detailed comments on the commits. To switch modes, config/settings/*.yml should have a keycard.access property. The default is direct, which assumes no proxy. See Keycard for more details on the changes from RequestAttributes to the family of classes. Note that this PR only uses the user_eid, which may or may not be present for all users. However, the user_pid is certainly not fit for display, so heliotrope will need to consider the relationship between id/user_key/email on the model and user_eid/user_pid/mail from Keycard for login, identification, and display purposes. This PR does not address institutional affiliation by way of Shibboleth login. That will have to happen by way of some treatment of the supplement attributes of eduPersonScopedAffiliation and/or identity_provider.
