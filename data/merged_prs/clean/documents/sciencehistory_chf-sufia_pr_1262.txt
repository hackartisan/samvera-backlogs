Better filenames for downloaded audio files, both originals and derivatives.
This PR changes the way downloaded audio files are named. The existing set up was unusable for oral history derivatives, as our current recipe for derivative download names uses the first three words of the work title, which, for oral histories, are always "Oral History Interview". Here's a summary of the changes: BEFORE Original files: <first three words of edited name of *fileset*>_<fileset id>.<original file extension> Derivatives: <first three words of *work* title>_<generic work id>_<fileset id>_<derivative label>.<derivative extension> AFTER Originals and derivatives for non-audio files: as above. Originals for audio files: mark_h_0030_1_1.mp3 <edited name of fileset>.<original file extension> Derivatives for audio files: mark_h_0030_1_1.flac <edited name of fileset>.<derivative extension> Note: audio download filenames in the playlist were buggy. This PR also fixes that.
