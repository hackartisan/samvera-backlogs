Don't index raw edtf date for front end
Fixes nulib/next-generation-repository#638 Fixes nulib/next-gen-front-end-react#105  The front end does not need both the raw and humanized EDTF string - only the display form. (The DateRange and DateSlider components use expanded_date and year). This won't require changes to the common_indexer gem.
