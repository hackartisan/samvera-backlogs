adds accession_number service and validations
Fixes nulib/next-generation-repository#438  adds an accession number service to check for duplicate accession numbers adds validation to image model for accession number uniqueness on create  Note that there is an issue if the user tries to create an Image through the UI that has a duplicate accession, receives an error, and then tries to correct and resubmit the form, an error is thrown. (This happens for any field resubmit after validation). I'll open a separate issue to look into this. In the case of accession number I'd argue it's more important to get something in there to prevent bad/duplicate data, and leave the outstanding issue for later. Right now nothing prevents a duplicate record through the UI. I think the case of users actually entering duplicate accessions is (hopefully) pretty rare.
