Import the "Personal or Corporate Name.photographer" column in CSVs to photographer
Connected to CAL-648  Some DLCS collections use the field "Personal or Corporate Name.photographer" for the photographer name. This CSV column should import to the property "photographer" in californica. When I import a collection CSV that has data in the Personal or Corporate Name.photographer column, the data is saved to the "Photographer" (photographer) field.
