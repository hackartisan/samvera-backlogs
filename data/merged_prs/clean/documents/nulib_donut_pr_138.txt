Use AWS Simple Server Manager Parameter Store...
... instead of environment variables for deploy-time and runtime configuration The Problem Deploying new code causes Elastic Beanstalk to replace instances and run through health checks and tests. Changing environment variables does the same. There's no way to do both at the same time, so any code change that requires an environment update requires two EB deploy cycles. The Solution Use the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for shared configuration settings, and use the EB environment only for things that differ between the webapp and worker environments. Settings changes will then require a restart or reboot, but not a full redeploy. Code changes and environment changes can happen simultaneously.
