DLTP-1258: Sort missing to bottom
DLTP-1258: Sort missing to bottom e3adbea This can be done at query time using something like 'sort=if(ord(date_created_derived_dtsim),ord(date_created_derived_dtsim),999999) asc', but I decided to do it at the schema level. This required a number of changes:  Change the schema for the _dtsi field to sortMissingLast Change the model to use a single value date field. Which meant changing the params passed to solrizer's create_and_insert_terms method to :stored_sortable, and passing a single date instead of an array of strings (otherwise it would not recognize it as a date field and wouldn't add the _dt suffix Changed the catalog controller to match, and no longer need to use ord function since we can sort on a single value date field naturally. This also meant fixing a problem with the Dockerfile. Was previously just using the downloaded schema/configs. Had to add a copy command to make sure that the schema used in dev/test were up to date with what's in the curate repo.
