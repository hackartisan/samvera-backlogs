Fix collection manifests with MVWs.
When collection manifests have multi-volume works the thumbnail_id of the MVW points to the scanned resource within it that has the thumbnail it should use, rather than the FileSet. The thumbnail builder was assuming it'd get back a FileSet, which caused an error to be thrown while embedding thumbnails in those manifests. The error can be seen here:  The change here iterates down thumbnail_ids until it finds a FileSet, and if it doesn't it just doesn't append a thumbnail to the manifest.
