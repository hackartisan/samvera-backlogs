WIP Noid template
This code is currently running on SS1QA.  We will see if we end up with less errors. This PR is a work in progress, but it does the following things:  Updates Sufia to get the temp files with the name extension Changed the noid template to remove the id conflicts Overrides the GenericFileTranslator, FileSetBuilder, and VersionBuilder to run characterization and in one new job and then delete the temp file after it is done.  Unfortunately we had to override the entire chain to insert our new code in VersionBuilder  What still needs to be done:  a code review and cleanup the commits. point back at the sufia 7-2.migration branch now that the file name changes have been merged. Move the new Import job to the files queue instead of the ingest queue so the cleaner works on the correct queue and we do not delete any long running ingest jobs Check how the import when and verify that we are no longer getting errors with items already existing
