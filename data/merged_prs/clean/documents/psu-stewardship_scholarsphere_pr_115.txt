Allow only editable collections in the collection list. fixes #109
Overriding to find only collections with edit access.  Sufia currently finds any collections (read, or edit access). Doing this here for the moment to facilitate the release.  Need to have a community discussion to see if this is need/wanted in sufia.  I can not see why a a user might select a collection they do not have edit access to, but there may be a change in sufia I am unaware of.
