Add full text searching for PDFs
This commit introduces two classes that can be used to index full text content of PDFs intro Solr. There is a FullTextExtractor class and a FullTextToSolrJob class. The first one handles getting the the extracted text from Solr by posting the PDF data to Solr. The job class gets the full text and updates the Solr index with the text. To run the job: FullTextToSolrJob.new("fk4jq25q2f", Image.first.file_sets[0].files.first.content).perform The first param is the SolrDocument id, and the second param is a PDF datastream in an ActiveFedora object.
