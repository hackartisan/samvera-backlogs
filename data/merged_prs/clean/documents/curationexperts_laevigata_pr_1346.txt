Add Box UI to form
This commit adds the box file picker to the form and sets up OAuth login. To get this running locally you'll need to setup the BOX_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID and BO_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET env variables. When you click on 'Add You Thesis From Box' you will be redirected to the Box login and then redirected back to the submission form. A Box file picker UI will then be in the UI. When you pick a file the box_redirect_controller will communicate with the Box servers and get the correct download URL. Future commits will use that URL to add the file to the InProgressEtd.
