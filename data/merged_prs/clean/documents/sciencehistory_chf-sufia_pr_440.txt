WIP date range facet/slider
This needs to be evaluated by stakeholders for UX -- either we need to reserve staging for a few days for that, or we can just deploy to production and get eval there before closing issue #329 Some oddities to keep aware of:   The potential date input is various, and includes possible ambiguous or erroneous dates, or date information it's hard to represent completely accurately in a timeline/facet limit.  If a date is marked 'before', 'after', or 'circa', it's indexed for the limit the same as if it had no qualifier at all. "before 1950" is put on the timeline at 1950. If a date has a 'start' of "decade" or "century", the "finish" is ignored.  Something entered as "Start: 1950s, End: 1962", will jut be indexed as "1950s", ie 1950-1959. A finish before a start is ignored, just the start is indexed. Something with a qualifier but no date is ignored. Something with "Undated" qualifier but also a date is treated as just "Undated" and not put on the timeline. Date entry that isn't in YYYY(-mm(-dd)) format is just ignored.    Date ranges are a bit weird for the histogram summary. For instance. Recall that the histogram summary appears for the current result set to let you limit further, if you've already limited with a query or facet choices, the date facet histogram summary characterizes the current result set. i'll choose some 'extreme' examples to illustrate the issue.  Imagine your current result set includes 100 documents, all of which are indexed as 1900-1950. The histogram will make it look like there are 100 documents in each date segment, but when you click on them, it's the same 100 documents each time. Or, imagine the result set includes those same 100 documents indexed 1900-1950, but another 100 indexed as 1951.  The histogram will make it look there are an equal number of documents throughout the timeline, but in fact if you limit to just 1951 you get 100 distinct documents, but limit to any other year in the range you get the other 100 documents.    Additionally there's a small UI bug in the blacklight_date_range gem that I want to try to fix.
