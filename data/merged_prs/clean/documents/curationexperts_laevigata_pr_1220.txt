New UI testing: creating a Hyrax ETD
This commit allows a user to persist an in-progress ETD, view and then successfully submit it for publication as a Hyrax ETD. It contains hard-coded values for parts of the new Vue form that are as yet not built out (committee data, uploaded and supplemental files, embargo data, and the agreement). As those parts of the form are built they will replace the hard-coding. The in-progress ETD is submitted as form-data to Hyrax, although the original intention had been to submit JSON data (the Hyrax controller does not seem to parse JSON). This will probably allow us to re-use most of our Vue structures. The submit occurs from the 'show' view of the in-progress-etds, so  The user testing with this code is expected to have at least one UploadedFile record in their local database, the id 1 is hard-coded. Creating a Hyrax ETD with the old UI and a pdf will create that object and row in the database. See this article for information about using Rails instance variables in Vue components:
