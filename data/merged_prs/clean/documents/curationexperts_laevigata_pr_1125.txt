 Improve embargo management UX and remove "Deactivate Embargo" button 
The terminology in embargo management pages is frequently overly wordy and unclear out of the box. Particularly, "deactivate" is overloaded: meaning "release"/"lift" when the embargo release date is past, and meaning "reset item permissions to embargoed and mark the embargo inactive" otherwise. In list_expired_active_embargos, the former is always the case, so we say "Release" to reduce confusion ("Release", rather than "lift", is the terminology used elsewhere). While we're here, we tighten up some other values to avoid overly wordy and vague text, (e.g. "Cancel and manage all embargoes" becomes "Manage Embargoes"). The counter-intuitive "Deactivate Embargo" button is also removed. Related to curationexperts/nurax#205 & samvera/hyrax#3058. Closes #1108.
