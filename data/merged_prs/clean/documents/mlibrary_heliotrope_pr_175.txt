Settings
This changeset will get rid of the custom load-yaml-file code in config/initializers/curation_concerns.rb. In return it introduces a new level of config: config/settings/<env>.yml instead of config/curation_concerns.yml. I would prefer to to consolidate the settings into a config/settings.yml with defaults and all the environments (like we do in database.yml, etc.).  helped me search for a consolidated solution. Using the send method (e.g. config.derivatives_path = Settings.send(Rails.env).derivatives_path) made the test suite fail due to a pre-existing method test. Adding settings = eval "Settings.#{Rails.env}" offended rubocop and seemed like a dangerous precedent. So falling back on this more diffuse solution. If/when we merge this PR, we need to update the configuration on all machines running in production mode. Closes #91.
