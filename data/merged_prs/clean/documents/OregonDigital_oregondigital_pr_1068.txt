Set up docker for development and testing
This is squashed as requested, and includes all the following:  Updates json to 1.8.3 due to build errors in 1.8.1 Updates some of the bigger github gems to use shallow copies Updates redis setup to allow custom backend server Updates all environments to allow custom memcached servers Updates Fedora and solr configs to be environmentally configurable in all environments Sets up custom solr image with OD-specific core and configs Creates a phantomjs image with a prebuilt binary Wraps jetty inside custom image to isolate Fedora more easily Sets up dev-centric compose file for easily tying services together Creates a test image and compose file to keep test and dev separate Dev dockerfile is set up to cache an initial gem state while still re-running bundler when Gemfile changes, which speeds up dev when Gemfile has minor changes All old setup is retained to ensure CI servers and existing devs can continue to work without using docker
