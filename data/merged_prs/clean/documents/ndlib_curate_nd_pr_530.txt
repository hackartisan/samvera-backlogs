Add OSF archives to search
The basic view for showing OSF archives in search was added in PR #527. This change adds an additional description field to that view. Changes:  Added Description to the search results view for OSF Archives In prior work on show/edit forms, there was no mention of description, so I'm adding here as well. This meant changing the model and datastream a bit:  The model was set to allow multiple values for description, which is not a requirement and causes problems with the input fields. The description wasn't being added to the solr doc, so changed the datastream to index the field.
