Migrate to CircleCI 2.0
Fixes #478 Local Checklist   QA-ed locally?  Rebased with master branch?  Configuration updated (if needed)?  What does this PR do? removes the legacy circle.yml CI file and replaces with a 2.0 compatible config file. Why are we doing this? Any context of related work? References #478 Noting that our test suite takes an incredibly long time to run now. Almost 1.5 hours. This is quite bad. It would be worth trying to get this down to a more reasonable length, but that's not in the scope of this ticket. /developers - please review
