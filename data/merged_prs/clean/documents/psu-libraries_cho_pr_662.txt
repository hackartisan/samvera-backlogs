Apply CSV metadata to FileSet
Description When importing works that contain file sets, read the metadata for each file set from the provided csv. We can determine if a row of the csv is a file set or work and then pass this information on to the transaction which will apply the metadata when creating the file set. Connected to #582 Changes   File sets' member ids are no longer required. This means that we can create a file set without any files, which seems reasonable. In this case, we want to validate the file set's metadata as it's coming our of the csv, so it won't have any files attached to it yet.   CsvReader is more domain-specific. Because a line in a csv could either be a work or a file set, it seemed to make sense for the CsvReader to make that distinction. The downside is that the reader now needs to know more specific things about which columns are in the file.   SubmissionChangeSet as more virtual properties. This is better than just attr_accessors but adds a little more cognitive mass to the change set. It seems like a reasonable addition given that we're already passing import works along as well.   member_of_collection_ids is no longer required. The determining factor between whether or not a csv row is a work or file set is the presence or absence of the collection id. So, the csv can have empty collection id fields.
