Adds typed title field
Adds distinct properties for various title types to the Asset model. Creates a custom input that combines a text inputs with a selet box for the type. Modifies AssetForm object to split distinct properties for each title type into a structure suitable for displaying as a combination of select box (for the title type) and a text box (for the title). Adds logic to AssetActor to modify the environment on #create and #update. The modifications combine the title and title type fields from the submitted form data into distinct properties for each title type on the model before saving. Modifies form partials for edit fields to allow for multiple title/title_type paris, and ensure they are pre-populated. Modifies AssetPresenter, relevant view partials to display all the different title types. Adds a controlled vocabulary for title and description types. Adds helper methods for dealing with Asset create/update forms in Capybara.  Also,  MultipleTextSelectComboInput#collection overrides MultiValueInput#collection (from hydra_editor). This may be a useful patch to hydra_editor.
