Adds initial work for testing SolrDoc with new metadata
This is an in progress PR. I have included BasicMetadata so that a work could be created without errors. This will cause some tests to fail (for example: we have tests written for publisher to be single-valued, however it is multi-valued in Hyrax::BasicMetadata). Unit tests written for checking metadata returned by SolrDoc also are failing right now. I am not sure why primary_language and abstract have suffix _tesim when they should have _tesi and _tes respectively. This is something we might need to look into. Connected to #110 Update (04/08): The final commit tests if SolrDoc saves and returns the saved values correctly. This test will currently fail because of the exclusion of BasicMetadata
