Adding version numbers to all migrations
Without these, the software will not install on a clean postgres database. ALSO: I noticed over the weekend that we were mixing sqlite in dev and test with postgres in production. This is explicitly contraindicated by the rails community, and can lead to unexpected problems. We decided as a team awhile ago that if we're using postgres in production we should be using it in dev and test too. I put in a PR to move laevigata to using postgres in dev and test. Once this PR is merged, you must re-create your local development database and clean out fedora.
