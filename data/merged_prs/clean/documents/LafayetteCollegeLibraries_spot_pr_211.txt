add i18n misses to local hyrax.en.yml file
look, i have absolutely no idea why the hyrax gem locales don't load occasionally. these are the things i'm worried that it might be related to:  bootsnap (clearing tmp/cache sometimes helps) config.to_prepare callback being used to load overrides (clearing this sometimes helps) some other mysterious Rails dark force that i don't know about?  i don't have a good fix + i can't find anything on the internet about it, so i'm worried it's a local goof somewhere. but for now, whenever there's a translation miss, we'll just fill in the local hyrax.en.yml file. oh also, the fix for the collection_type badges was editing their value in the database; when they were created, a translation missing error was raised and became their forever titles ðŸ˜ž closes #208
