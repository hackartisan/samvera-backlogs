Create spaces in text fields for indexing
Uses Solr's MappingCharFilterFactory to replace underscores and other characters with spaces so that search on their parts yields search results. Text and string fields are copied to the all_text_timv field, removing the suggest fields, which aren't being used. Note: This will require reindexing Solr for the fix to take effect.
