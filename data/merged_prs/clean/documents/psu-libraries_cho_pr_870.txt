Adding a rake task to create a bag that is able to be imported
Example rake cho:bag:create_from_path[/Users/cam156/Downloads/thumb2_2019-03-13]  Example Directory cam156@L5-PW3-153-233[~/Downloads]> find thumb2_2019-03-13/* thumb2_2019-03-13/thumb2 thumb2_2019-03-13/thumb2/thumb2_00001_01_thumb.png thumb2_2019-03-13/thumb2/thumb2_00001_01_preservation.tif  Description For testing purposes it is nice to have the ability to quickly create bags from various test files. The requirements for the bag and the zipped file are a bit ambiguos and it is hard to create them on a mac without the .DS_Store files.  This rake task will create a bag from a directory of files in the correct structure.
