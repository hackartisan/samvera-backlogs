Use update route for updating InProgressEtd record.  Part of story #1285
The previous code was performing updates to the record in the controller's create action.  I moved that code into the update action, so that we would be using conventional Rails-style RESTful routes with our Vue form.   In order to build the update route, the javascript needs to know the record ID.  I added a method to the model that will add the ID to the JSON data store when the record is created, so that the ID will be available to the javascript.   The new action in the controller just does a find_or_create, and once the record has been created, it redirects to the edit action to render the form so the user can start editing.
