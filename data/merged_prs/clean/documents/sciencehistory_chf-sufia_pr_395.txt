WIP description field formatting
closes #327   HTML-aware truncation needed  Okay,this doesn't yet do any data migration, but is complete for new data. Before considering what data migration we may need, let's consider what this will do to existing data. Right now, if you have html tags in your description, they'll be exposed as HTML source: <p>Let's say <em>I</em> wrote <ul><li>this</li></ul>.</p>  It'll show up just like that. After this change, the tags will be stripped out on display to the public, if someone looks at the record, it will look like this: "Let's say I wrote this." if they open it up in the editor, they will see the original code with tags, BUT if they save it without changing it, it will strip out the tags on save too, they'll be gone forever. Or they can edit it to be right and save it of course. If existing text has allowed html tags, they'll stay there, won't be stripped out. If existing text has newlines, they'll be properly converted. So for instance if something had <p> tags and double-newlines seperating paragraphs, it'll show up just right -- p tags will be stripped out, but newlines will be converted back to p tags. So this isn't actually that terrible. It depends on the nature of the data, and the nature of our stakeholder expectations for how much we have to do to accomodate their erroneous unsupported past use -- and how likely someone is to open up an edit page, and save it again without noticing the description needs to be fixed first. From production:  Number of records with <p> in description: 22 Number of records with <em> in description: 2 Number of records with <strong> in description: 0 Number of records with <table> in description: 0 (phew)  So we may not have to do any migration at all?
