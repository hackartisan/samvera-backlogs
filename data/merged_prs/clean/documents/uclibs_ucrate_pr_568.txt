Override description and date_created predicates
Fixes #554 This fixes our problem where the application was not seeing existing content in the description and data_created fields because the prefix in Fedora was different. Once a property has been declared for a field in Hyrax, we can't re-declare it in our app.  So I had to override the entire app/models/concerns/hyrax/basic_metadata.rb file in Hyrax and change the property lines for description and data_created to match the prefixes used in Scholar 3.x. I pushed this change to scholar-qa and was then able to see the existing content in those fields.   Example:  So I've verified it's working. Just in case we ever lose this override, I added tests to each of the work type models to verify description and data_created have the predicates we expect. Before this change:  Article.properties["description"].predicate.to_s returns "" Article.properties["date_created"].predicate.to_s returns ""  After this change:  Article.properties["description"].predicate.to_s returns "" (matches Scholar 3.x) Article.properties["date_created"].predicate.to_s returns "" (matches Scholar 3.x)
