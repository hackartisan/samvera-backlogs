Clean `PermissionTemplate` instances when clean task destroys AdminSets
When destroying an AdminSet, the attached PermissionTemplate in the relational database need to be cleaned up. If this is neglected, recreating the default AdminSet (or any other admin set with a previously existing id). The californica:ingest:clean task is changed to destroy existing permission templates after running ActiveFedora::Cleaner.clean!. This should restore the functionality of nightly ingest.
