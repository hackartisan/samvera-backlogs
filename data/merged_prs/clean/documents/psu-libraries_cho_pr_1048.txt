Adding a viewing context to works in collections
Description Expands the nested resources controller to include a show view. This enables viewing a work within its containing collection and serves as a mechanism for browsing through paginated lists of works in a collection. Connected to #807 Changes  adds a route to /archival_collections/:archival_collection_id/resources/:id distinguishes between the catalog search/browse and the collection search/browse  Caveats There may be some unintended confusion the search results from a catalog search and those from a collection search. They appear to be mostly separate, however, there might be some yet-to-be-seen issues. Also, file sets still display within the context of the catalog controller and not their containing resource.
