Claiming issue DLTP-792 @2ec4339ba78e23a4f0be894c1d0bbd31b9035143 $ ./script/start-issue DLTP-792 [skip ci] Removing writing logs to unicorn stdout log @043cc4c0f0eb4bf016f065174b3a2079467ed2c8 The following line shows why we are likely writing $stderr to unicorn  As I was debugging this I encountered a caching-type behavior. If I changed the code on how unicorn starts then deployed the changes, the restart unicorn wouldn't always use the right RAILS_ENV. What I needed to do to get this working was to SSH onto the machine and stop the unicorn process then restart it. It was as thought the -E option were either cached or continued to be used.
