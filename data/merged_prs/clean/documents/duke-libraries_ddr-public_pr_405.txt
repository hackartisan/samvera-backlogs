revised testing for login-to-download button
AFAIK the 'Registered' group didn't end up being a usable distinction for when to render which buttons, so it's irrelevant in the tests. Any logged-out users encountering a file where Public agent doesn't have Downloader role will get the "Login to Download" button; if they click it and log in, then they will get either the green download button (if their account is permitted) or the red Not Authorized button (if their account isn't).
