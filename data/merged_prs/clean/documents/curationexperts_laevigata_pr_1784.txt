 Cast `#*_embargoed` values to boolean in the model
Various parts of the codebase set these flags to true/false or "true"/(""|"false"|nil). These are interpreted in SolrDocument, but the model itself is unable to tell a caller whether these values are embargoed with any reliability. The fix included here is to override the setters and getters for these values to cast aggressively to a Boolean value. Since SolrDocument already has this logic baked in, this ensures both the model and the index give the intended value. We can deprecate setting with string values and remove the overrides once users of this approach (notably the submission forms) have been cleaned up. Fixes #1763
