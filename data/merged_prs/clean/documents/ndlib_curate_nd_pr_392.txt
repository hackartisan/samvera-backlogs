#376 Attribute text should never contain lists
Claiming issue 376 @e3b119438add8dc1be935ac018b8670b246cdd1d relates to #376 $ ./script/start-issue 376 [skip ci] Copying over TextFormatter spec from Curate gem @9dec4769c6f1daa84fadc50cf9a239a5686e6846 Use ActiveSupport convenience method to strip heredoc whitespace @4a3462f71b95a33bb045750a64edfda4d3bb8b95 Refining TextFormatter spec formatting @143e0e562c0fafb388ed664b84b7e06d32cb24a8 Test cases for inline and block level rich text rendering @5a1091c0f0b751fd0d312fc5f153bc64b5d1fac2 "Inline" text rendering is for anything that can be captured by an input field and the output would be contained in a single <p> tag. This is the most common the use cases for rich text in CurateND. It includes object attributes and titles. In these contexts the list style syntax causes undesired behavior. "Block" text rendering is for anything that can be captured by a textarea field and the output would be contained in multiple <p> tags. It is used sparingly in CurateND. Tests for block-level text rendering @c403c07518c399d86923a5c8d25660c86a05c800 These test existing behavior and are meant to help prevent regression failures. Moving to Redcarpet for markdown parsing @6d9558a99bf52ecac64cc81547937de24743fb39 Redcarpet does not support alphabetical ordered lists. This is probably fine as it is not a part of the original markdown specification. Exposing :block flag for TextFormatter in helper methods @a947760ae4c4634ee4dbe7a52067d96eef60ff40 curation_concern_attribute_to_formatted_text sends block: true by default because it is used to render abstracts and descriptions. curation_concern_attribute_to_html send block: false by default because it is used to render single-line attributes.
