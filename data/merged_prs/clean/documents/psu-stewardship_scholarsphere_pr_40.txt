Removes head_tag_content override to pick up Google Scholar tags from Sufia. Fixes #620.
This work required first getting ScholarSphere working on top of Sufia 4.1.0, which included proxy- and transfer-related code ported from ScholarSphere, so this meant a lot of deletion and cleanup. Then I needed to tweak Sufia to allow downstream head content injection, which is sitting in a branch awaiting a PR merge here: samvera-deprecated/sufia#714 The last step was creating a new override in ScholarSphere to inject the favicon_link_tag that isn't in Sufia. A new spec test is included to make sure the favicon exists. ‼️ If you want to wait for the Sufia PR to be closed first so our Gemfile points at the master branch rather than a short-lived feature branch, that's cool -- I can tweak the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock once that happens, squash, and force-push the changes here.
