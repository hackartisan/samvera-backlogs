Show a fileset's files as a table with type, size
Description On the File Set landing page, replace the list of file downloads with a table, which shows the filename (which itself is a link to download the file) along with the file size and the file type of each available file Please be aware that the file size is not stored anywhere in a File's metadata at the moment, which means that we have to hit the disk for every file in this list on every page view. This could have scaling issues down the road, for instance if the files are stored in a cloud service, or just not on the same machine as the web server. I would like to see the file size stored in the database but we are splitting that out into a separate ticket. Mike and I are going to be pairing on some UI stuff tomorrow so I'm hoping we'll take a look through this one as well.
