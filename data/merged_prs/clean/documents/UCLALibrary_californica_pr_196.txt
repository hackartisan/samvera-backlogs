Show metadata terms on show page
This adds additonal setup for the existing custom metadata terms so that they can be displayed on the show view of an Work. In order for them to be used by the WorkPresenter they need to explicilty indexed in the model. The WorkPresenter needs to have references to the to the terms. The _attribute_rows.html.erb view needs to be overidden to include the additional attributes. The catalog_controller needs to be updated with all attributes that you want to see in the view. There is a view spec that tests for the presence of the the attributes on that page. Connected to #195
