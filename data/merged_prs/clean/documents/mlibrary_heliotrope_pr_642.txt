Resolves #634
We're having problems with the google bot crawling the site so frequently that it uses up our 50,000/day google analytics API quota. So we need to cache it.  A rake task to cache google analytics data to the Rails.cache Refactored the analytics_presenter to use the Rails.cache  When this is merged, add a cron in staging, preview and production to call the rake task to build the ga_cache. Something like: 0 3 * * * cd /hydra-dev/heliotrope-staging/current; RBENV_ROOT=/l/local/rbenv RBENV_VERSION=2.3.0 RAILS_ENV=production /l/local/rbenv/bin/rbenv exec bundle exec rake heliotrope:ga_cache
