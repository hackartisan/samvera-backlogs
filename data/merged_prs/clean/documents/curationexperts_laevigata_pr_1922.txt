Rebrand application name
There are two commits here: one removes all references to "Electronic" in text anywhere in the application User Interface; the second updates  the SVG logo to remove the same word. Emory may wish to further refine the logo, I was able to delete the word "Electronic" from the logo and shift other text to remove extra whitespace giving this image:  I've deployed the branch to  if anyone wants to take a look at the changes. Please feel free to further modify the rebrand branch if there are places that I've removed references to "Electronic" that Emory would like to keep.
