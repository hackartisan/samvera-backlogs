Preserve ScannedResources to the cloud on save
This backs up all ScannedResources and associated FileSets if they're configured to backup to cloud storage via the form. In Development and Test, by default, it stores items in a tmp directory. However, users can configure a staging bucket in development to test GCS functionality.
