You needed to remember to use create_for_repository.  Since almost all of our resources are Valkyrie resources this seemed backwards to me. References ticket: (if any) Why was this necessary? Changes  CreateForReporitory is registered as create instead of create_for_repository A generic to_create for valkyrie index resources was defined in the rails helper Tests were changes to use create instead of create_for_repository Any factory that used the indexing persister no longer needed the to_create so that was removed The User factory now needed a specialized to_create so that was added  Are there any major changes in this PR that will change the release process?
