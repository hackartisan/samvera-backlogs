Feature/#78c collection export
Closes #78 Adds MVC for Collection Metadata Export  2 Hyrax overrides to add buttons/links to the new feature:  app/views/hyrax/dashboard/collections/_show_actions.html.erb app/views/hyrax/my/_collection_action_menu.html.erb spec/views/hyrax/dashboard/collections/_show_actions.html.erb_spec.rb spec/views/hyrax/my/_collection_action_menu.html.erb_spec.rb   Permissions for collection_export inherit from associated collection - if that is missing, it looks at the user who created the instance Specs for:  Controller Feature Ability   Added static 403 error page  Considerations:  There's a blocker with the feature spec - see the commented section - this feature is well tested via the view override specs (which look for the button) and  other feature spec expectations, which are looking at the same actions. No model code/specs - there was no need for validations for the model, so I didn't add anything here The need for view specs is covered by the feature spec.
