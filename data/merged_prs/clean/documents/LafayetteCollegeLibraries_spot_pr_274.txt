add standard/local identifier form fields
revamps how we're handling identifiers within forms by splitting out 'local' and 'standard' identifiers into their own separate form fields. what determines a value's place depends on its return value of Spot::Identifier.from_string(identifier).standard? or `Spot::Identifier.from_string(identifier).local? # app/forms/hyrax/image_form.rb module Hyrax   class ImageForm < ::Hyrax::Forms::WorkForm     include ::IdentifierFormFields     self.terms = [:title, :standard_identifier, :local_identifier]   end end also adds a shared-spec for the mixin, so testing your forms works like: # spec/forms/hyrax/image_form_spec.rb RSpec.describe Hyrax::ImageForm do   it_behaves_like 'it handles identifier form fields' end
