add language-tagged literals to work fields
This doesn't directly affect the Publication model as much as the forthcoming Image/ScannedResource one, but to prepare for that we want to add the ability to language-tag free-text fields where necessary. In current metadata, we have fields such as title_english, title_japanese, description_korean (etc) for our scanned items (see: East Asia Image Collection) and we would like to retain this granularity. Using RDF language-tagged literals seems the best way to capture this. To accomplish this, we'll need to add form support as well as batch ingest support (and, if we're feeling limber, some kind of UI support, though that can get punted 'til later). I'm trying to do this in a reusable way so that later integration with the Image work type won't require a lot of heavy lifting. Publication properties targeted:   title  subtitle  title_alternative  abstract  description  to-do   form submission handling  input type for singular fields  input type for multi fields  add tagging to mappers   lafayette newspaper  lafayette magazine  shakespeare bulletin (skipping faculty publications as they're not all English-language titles)    add placeholder text for inputs  fix styling warp when new rows are added (i think this is a problem at the bootstrap layer. see #92)  can we do anything about making the language input a bit bigger? adding a label?  closes #79
