Cleanup creator and other facets prior to indexing
This is a solution to #632. I'm not too keen on it. The initial solution is simple: cleanup facet terms before sending them to solr such that ADAM WEAD becomes Adam Wead. However, it gets complicated because we have linked facets, urls that map to catalog searches with a given faceted search. Because we've changed the facet but not the actual value the user entered, the links don't work. The solution then is to modify the links so that they display the original user's entered text, but link to the modified facet term. This is kind of icky because we're essentially modifying twice: first on the way in (to Solr) and then on the way out again when we display. The solution below could be made more efficient, perhaps. But it strikes me that the ideal solution might be to modify the user input in the first place, normalizing values upfront. Thoughts?   ?
