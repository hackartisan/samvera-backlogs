Allow the user to convert between child works and files
Allows the user to convert between child works and files. Features  Only one item can be converted at a time. I've put some work into doing several items at a time, but that functionality isn't on this branch; we want to get this working before embarking on that more ambitious project. The order of items in the parent work is preserved. Thumbnail and "representative" status are preserved. Converting a child work to a file deletes metadata, but the user is warned before the operation starts. We run a bunch of checks, both client and server side, before the conversion begins. The user interface is pretty simple - we're just adding buttons on the "File Detail" and item record pages. Converting from a fileset to a child work takes time, but is not substantially slower than creating a GenericWork would be in other circumstances, even when the fileset is part of a work that has several hundred other filesets and dozens of GenericWorks in its member set.
