Workaround ActiveFedora's non-persistence of nested attributes
ActiveFedora fails to persist when using indexed nested attributes like: { my_property_attributes: { '0' => { name: ['moomin'] } } }  The library does not propagate changes made in this way to #resource which prevents them from being added to the ActiveFedora::ChangeSet and sent to Fedora. As a work-around, we call persist! manually on known nested attributes in the actor stack. This ensures that updates made through the form (and only those made through the form) are properly saved. We also change an existing test to document a workable procedure for changing nested attributes directly using the models. Fixes #1376
