replace imagemagick iiif calls with netpbm calls for tiffs #400
Resolves #400 This solves an immediate problem with very large (>200 MB) tiff files being processed by riiif and imagemagick. convert was loading the entire tiff in memory for each puma worker in order to generate IIIF tiles. This maxed out available ram in production and caused problems. The switch to netpbm's tifftopnm specifically with the -byrow flag cuts down ram usage considerably. This only works for tiffs, with the fallback to imagemagick for other file types (or if netpbm is not installed such as development environments). We can use other netpbm programs in the future for other large file types (jp2?) if needed.
