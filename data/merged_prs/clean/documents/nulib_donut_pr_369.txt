Don't consider completed status in dupe batch item check
Fixes nulib/next-generation-repository#715  The (batch) database check for a duplicate accession number currently considers items in 'initialized' or 'completed' status. Checking 'completed' status is a redundant check since we are also checking for the accession number in solr. (Checking initialized is necessary since we don't want to enqueue two jobs to create an item with the same accession number) Users want to be able to re-ingest a previously successfully created item if they delete the record from Hyrax. Getting rid of this redundant check will allow them to do this.
