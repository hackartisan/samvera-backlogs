validates and sets default value for status in batch
Fixes: nulib/next-generation-repository#484  creates local file based authority for status checks that provided status for batch items is valid if batch item status is blank, defaults to 'Not started'  Also:  cleans up extra copy/paste comment in our QaSelectServices for our other authorities syncs up resource_types authorities with the types sent to DataCite for ark. (Might want to still update list with values that we might actually use but at least now UI does not error for some selected values) changes reviewed status to done since we don't have a 'reviewed' status
