Rake task to batch load works from csv
Description Reads all the csv files from the network ingest directory, with their corresponding zip files, and imports them. If needed, it will created a collection with minimal metadata. This is largely throwaway code, but would be useful to have around for the duration of the MVP cycle where we could reload a bunch of csvs and zips with a single rake command.
