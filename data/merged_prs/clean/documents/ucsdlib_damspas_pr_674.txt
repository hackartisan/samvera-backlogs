Revert custom RCDP collection sort
The system modified date is not acceptable Leave tests pending so we can re-use them when we have a better solution  References #644 Local Checklist   Tests written and passing locally?  Code style checked?  QA-ed locally?  Rebased with master branch?  Configuration updated (if needed)?  Documentation updated (if needed)?  What does this PR do? This revert the change to use the system_modified_dtsi field in Solr for sorting RDCP collections. It does leave in place the tests that were written, it's just marked them as pending. Hopefully we can enable and reuse these tests once we have a different solution in place. Why are we doing this? Any context of related work? References #644 A more appropriate solution is being discussed in #643 and a new PR will be made once we have that sorted out. /developers - please review
