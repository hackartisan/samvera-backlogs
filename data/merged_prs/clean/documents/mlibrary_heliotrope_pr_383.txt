add custom footer at the press, monograph, and asset level
Resolves #314 NOTE: adds a new column press_url to the presses table to capture the presses url (ie ).  So you will need to run: bundle exec rake db:migrate then bundle exec rake db:seeds to populate the updated presses table. TODO:  I can't figure out how to get the press logo (logo_path) and the press url (press_url) into the presenters for the monograph and asset, or what the best way to go about doing this is (probably don't need to be indexed in solr, do they?). The footer design looks for the press logo and url and inserts them in the footer if they exist.
