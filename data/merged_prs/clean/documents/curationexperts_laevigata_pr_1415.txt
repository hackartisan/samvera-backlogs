Edit an ETD after it has been submitted. Story #1192
This code only handles most of the happy path (successful form saves), not the error path.  Currently it doesn't handle attached files, but should handle most of the metadata fields.   After the student submits the form, they will be redirected to the Etd show page.   I added an etd_id to the InProgressEtd model so that we can associate an InProgressEtd with the Etd record that it represents.   I added a method to the InProgressEtd model that allows you to refresh the JSON data store with the latest data from the Etd record.   I overrode a view partial from Hyrax so that I could change the 'Edit' button to route to the new controller when the new UI is enabled, but it should keep the old behavior if new UI is not enabled. (app/views/hyrax/base/_show_actions.html.erb)   I added code in the EtdsController to handle the Etd record update for the new UI.
