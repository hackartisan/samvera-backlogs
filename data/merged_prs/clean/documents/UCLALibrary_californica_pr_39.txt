Introduce an initial ingest tool with a title mapping
We are using the Darlingtonia gem as the framework for the ingest tool. We expect to develop this gem going forward to better support californica's scale requirements. This introduces a rake task for import from a MODS XML file, backed by a ModsXmlParser and a ModsMapper. for the moment, the mapper only maps #title. Closes #9
