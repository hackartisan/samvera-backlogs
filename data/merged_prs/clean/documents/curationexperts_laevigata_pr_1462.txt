Use VisibilityTranslator to determine and set `Etd#visibility`
Adds three new visibility levels to Etd. These are usable when an embargo is set. First we add delegation to a settable #visibility_translator (defaulting to an instance of VisibilityTranslator). This allows the Etd to infer its embargoed #visibility level based on the existing *_embargoed flags. We then add logic to VisibilityTranslator for setting visibility to the three new levels iff an embargo is set on the object. Future work will shift existing clients to using the visibility setters, instead of setting *_embargoed flags manually and add the new visibility levels to the embargo edit pages. We may also want to consider replacing the *_embargoed flags with data on the Embargo ActiveRecord objects.
