cache iiif manifests at the controller level
overwrites the default hyrax behavior for generating iiif manifests on an item to save the output to a cache. this should improve subsequent load times for items. to use: module Hyrax   class ImageController < ApplicationController     # ... Hyrax boilerplate: be sure to include this before the mixin      # cache the manifests!     include Spot::CachedManifestBehavior      # adjust how long we'll keep the docs around in the cache. default is 30.days     self.manifest_cache_duration = 180.days   end end (this adds the mixin to Hyrax::PublicationsController already) note: this includes some meta-programming because my initial pass was based on the master branch of Hyrax, which has sanitizing methods that aren't in 2.5.1. after the upgrade, you'll want to strip this out.
