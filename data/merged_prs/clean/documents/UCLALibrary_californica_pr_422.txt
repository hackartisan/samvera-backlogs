Pared down update stack
Metadata-only update when the deduplication field matches an existing record. That means it will not try to re-import attached files, it will only update metadata and collection membership.   Redirect logging in tests for better performance.   Remove temporary text-only collection facet.   Pass logging locations to DarlingtoniaImporter so success and failure counts go to the same log location as everywhere else.   Remove elapsed_time reporting from Californica in favor of the reporting now contained in Darlingtonia   Connected to #403 Connected to UCLALibrary/amalgamated-samvera#275
