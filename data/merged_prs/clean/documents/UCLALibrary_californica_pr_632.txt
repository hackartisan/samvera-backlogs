Generate IIIF Manifest for works with ChildWorks
The current views and libraries that generate the IIIF manifest and display the UV interface assume that the the Work is structured with an attached FileSet not additional works. The first Work requires an attached FileSet or it will not display. The overrides the generation of the manifest so that first Work will generate a manifest even if it  does not have an image/FileSet attached to it. This is done with a JBuilder view that the manifest is genreated from. Doing it this way it significantly faster. An Ethiopic manuscript was taking 5 minutes to genrate a manifest. This is down to 1 minute. That's still too slow, but it is still a large reduction. Connected to CAL-638
