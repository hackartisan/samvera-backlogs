New Terms and TermsBase, models for Person and Place.
I have updated the way terms work to use a TermsBase class and a set of modules included within a single Terms class. This seems a lot cleaner than a load of separate files. I've also added unlock and deep searching ( and also searching for person and place. I've added models and concerns for Person and Place and updated the concerns. I also switched qa to use the latest version in github (this isn't currently necessary but there are some new things we might want to search). Lastly, I moved the read_auth class into helpers as it's not really a model. I have tested all of this so it should not cause any problems.
