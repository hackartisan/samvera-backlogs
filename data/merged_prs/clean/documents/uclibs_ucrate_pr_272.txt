Fix specs and coveralls
This PR has 2 distinct commits and fixes some flaky tests and resolves a problem with permalinks that was leading to some oddness with Coveralls.  I'm putting them is the same pull request so it will have both passing tests and a passing coveralls score.   Adds a expect(page).to have_content "Select type of work" line to all feature specs that create a work. The current specs don't wait for the new work modal to show before moving forward. So if the modal is a little slow the test breaks. The expect I added causes the test to wait for the modal's "Select type of work" title to appear.  I ran the specs with this change many times locally and on Travis. The spec/features/create_* tests are not randomly failing anymore.   Permalinks for work show pages were broken for all work types except GenericWorks.  The #show method for works was missing a super.
