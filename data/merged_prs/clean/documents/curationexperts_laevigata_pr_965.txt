Setup `ImportUrlJob` (Box retrieval) to use the :ingest queue
Box retrieval is a high value task that runs the risk of timeout if delayed. It's also not a resource intensive task on our side; network latency probably accounts for most of the elapsed clock time. For this reason, it's a good idea to put this job in a high priority queue. We move it to :ingest. The other jobs there share similar properties. For clarity, we set this in the queues.rb initializer, which is where we are setting other queues originally set by Hyrax. Because we have a custom ImportUrlJob that specifies its queue, we set it there too, to avoid confusion. The initializer version runs later, and is canonical. See #961.
