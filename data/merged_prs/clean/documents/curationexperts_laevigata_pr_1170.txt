Add department dropdown to form
This commit adds the department dropdown back to the "About Me" portion of the form. Right now they are both on the "About Me" tab, but the workflow diagrams have the department dropdown on the next tab. This changes the name of the formSchema object to formStore to better reflect what that object is.  The object is a store from the Flux pattern:  That means that any changes to the state of the formStore object should be done using methods on the formStore object itself. That way the object can be used in many different components, with all of the changes happening in a known location.
