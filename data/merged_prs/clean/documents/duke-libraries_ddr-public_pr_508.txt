  this pull request updates the versions of Ruby and Rails for ddr-public. There are a few things you'll need to do in your VM environment to get this going:  In your VM's terminal install Ruby 2.3.1 with RVM and make sure that version is selected.  $ rvm install 2.3.1 $ cd /vagrant/ddr-public $ rvm use 2.3.1    Install bundler: $ gem install bundler   Install all the project's gems for this version of Ruby. $ bundle install   To start the Rails server you will need run this command instead of just rails s. $ ./bin/rails s -b 0.0.0.0   To get ready for Rails 5 and to reduce deprecation warnings in Rails 4.2.x you'll need to make a small change to following files (not in version control): config/environments/production.rb config/environments/test.rb config/environments/development.rb Change any occurrence of config.serve_static_assets to config.serve_static_files Let me know if you run into any issues.
