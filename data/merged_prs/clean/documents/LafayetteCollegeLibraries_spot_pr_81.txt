revamp controlled vocabularies
it feels super soon to do this, but better safe than sorry i guess? this updates some of #71 based on work done by folks at Northwestern University.   cache RDF labels to cut down on the number of requests we make (see #75)  update our rdf_service class to check the cache first  revert back to string values for Publication#language but use the iso-639 gem  use the label value provided by the Geonames API to match what users see in the edit form (see #77) update autocomplete form fields for:   language  academic_department  division    closes #75 closes #77
