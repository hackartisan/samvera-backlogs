Dltp 742 change rendering of image thumb
Change rendering of image thumbnails to avoid previewer unless Image type. New logic:  If representative is audio (no matter what class), use audio player else if class is either image or generic file, and representative is image, then image viewer else default thumbnail logic  Claiming issue DLTP-742 @06566ef5227b5a8b6deb22655062623259536d68 $ ./script/start-issue DLTP-742 [skip ci] Modify representative file logic @1a8c6f4d6eccc19a971397ae5a68db8eaa98f8e0 Display representative images according to work class rather than generic file class. Epub files were showing the representative file using the image viewer rather than standard thumbnail logic.
