Adds descriptive metadata part 2
This commit adds 10 more (10-20) descriptive metadata. Comments out inclusion of Hyrax's Basic metadata - We may not need all of the basic and core metadata. Commenting out the inclusion will allow us to define our required basic and core metadata. Adds publisher and date_created from basic metadata to forms. Edits create_curate_generic_work_spec to match available metadata properties - since we do not have basic and core metadata available, we will need to write tests with our set of metadata instead of tests with default metadata properties.  Closes #86
