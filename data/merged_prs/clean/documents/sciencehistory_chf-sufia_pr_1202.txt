update logger to a non-yanked version
nahi/logger#3 This is just the result of running bundle update --conservative logger. Based on above issue, I think 1.3.0 is equivalent to 1.2.8 that we were using before, now yanked. This comes up only because our jettywrapper dependency has an explicit dependency on logger. Logger is a part of stdlib, and doens't really need an explicit dependency. But it was also released as a separate gem to rubygems -- perhaps accidentally?  Perhaps  trying to clean that up after 7 years is why it was yanked?  I don't entirely understand what was going on, but the yanking of 1.2.8 will cause a problem for anyone that has an explicit logger dependency in their dependency tree, as we did/do.  We have no easy way to remove the explicit dependency, unless we stop using jettywrapper, which I'm not sure if we can or not. Easiest fix to make the app deployable and buildable again seems to be this.
