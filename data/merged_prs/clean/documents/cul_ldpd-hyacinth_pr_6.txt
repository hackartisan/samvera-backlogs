Replace "parent_digital_object" with "parent_digital_objects" in fixtures
Fixtures contain the wrong key to access the parent information inside the digital object data structure. The key used by the processing code is "parent_digital_objects". However, the fixtures use "parent_digital_object". Most (see NOTE below) instances of "parent_digital_object" in the fixtures will be replaced with "parent_digital_objects". NOTE: The following files were not updated, because a bug became apparent once the change was made. The update to the files will be made under the same commit that fixes the bug. The files are: spec/fixtures/sample_digital_object_data/new_asset.json spec/fixtures/sample_digital_object_data/new_item.json
