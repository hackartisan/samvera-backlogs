More build out of PBCore XML ingest
Adds class WGBH::BatchIngest::PBCoreXMLItemIngester to ingest BatchItems created by ingest types that read in PBCore XML. Changes ingest type to "aapb_pbcore_zipped", with label "AAPB PBCore -- Zipped", and uses PBCoreXMLItemIngester. Adds integration spec for aapb_pbcore_zipped ingest type. Adds helper methods to make it easy for specs to run an ingest. Imports factories for Batch and BatchItem models from hyrax-batch_ingest gem. Adds a batch for testing a dozen Asset-only records. Adds a helper method zip_to_tmp which will zip a path into a temporary location. This is so that we can keep unizpped example batches in the repo, but zip them up prior to testing. Adds pbcore gem to the bundle. Replaces use of PBCore::V2 namespaces from pb_core gem with just PBCore namespace from pbcore gem.  Also,  Fixes typo in class name from 'Ingestor' to 'Ingester'. Fixes typo in dir name from 'btach_ingest' to 'batch_ingest' Updates the hyrax-batch_ingest gem in the bundle (along w/ dependencies). Adds additional guard clause to avoid errors in AssetActor when dealing with typed fields that may not be present. Removes validation of Asset#admin_data_gid, this was causing issues due to AdminData being created only in a before_save hook (because before_validation hook is currently broken in ActiveFedora). Fixes bugs in ZippedPBCoreReader and it's spec. Fixes bug in before_save hook of Asset model that was not saving AdminData.
