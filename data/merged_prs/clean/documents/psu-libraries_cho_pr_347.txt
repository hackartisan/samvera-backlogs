Adding a metadata Schema that can be used for Works or Collections
Needed to update valkyrie to get my fix for inheritance This is a second PR that should be rebase off of master after #344 has been merge.  (The first commit in this PR is the commit for #344). This PR creates two models in the system a TemplateField, and a Template.  The assumption is the Template field contains most of the information and the Template basically contains a list of those fields. I am not certain I am in love with storing the TemplateField ids within the template, but I did not want to store them in two places (inside the model, and in the database as their own entity).  I added helper methods so the end user does not need to translate between model and ids.
