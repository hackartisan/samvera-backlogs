Use stateless ID minter for new AAPB ID
We were running into issues in deployed environments with our stateful minter, which requires providing concurrent access to a single persistence layer where the minter state is stored. Our IDs are random, and we don't have a use case for "replaying" the minting of them, so we can switch to a stateless minter and avoid the persistence layer requirement, and associated headaches. Our stateless minter replaces NOID, and is just the first 12 chars of a UUID with the constant prefix "cpb-aacip-" prepended to it. For every ID minted, we do a lookup in Solr to see if the ID exists yet, and if it does, we regenerate a new random ID. Also...  Provides an accessor to AMS.seeds, for manually creating seed data. This has proen useful more than once in development, so added it in.
