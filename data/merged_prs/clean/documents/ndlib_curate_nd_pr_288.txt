Grant temporary access to ETD files
We need a method for Shari to provide access to restricted files associated with ETDs. To that end I:  Genericized the idea of a repository manager so that it could apply to both managing the ETD controlled vocabularies as well as minting one-time-use access tokens Created an administrative interface for managing one-time-use access tokens Allowed the downloads controller to bypass normal access control enforcement when presented with a valid access token Added messaging to inform the patron about who to contact if they encounter a file that they are not permitted to view on the show page of an ETD Added a function to let ETD managers create single-use access URLs starting from an ETD show page  Much of this functionality could be extended to provide one-time access to restricted repository content in general but that was left out of scope. The primary concern is managing the requests as they come in when multiple repository administrators are involved.  Addresses #285
