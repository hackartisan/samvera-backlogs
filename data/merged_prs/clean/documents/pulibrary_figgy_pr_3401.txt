Order manager fetch state is never returned to false. The context of this in the isDisabled method:                figgy/app/javascript/components/OrderManagerControls.vue                    Line 100       in       f4d6b17                                                           if (this.$store.getters.stateChanged && !this.fetching) {                     is different from the context of this in the SAVED_STATE method:                figgy/app/javascript/store/resource/index.js                    Line 36       in       f4d6b17                                                     state.fetching = false                     The result is that the fetching state is never returned to false.
