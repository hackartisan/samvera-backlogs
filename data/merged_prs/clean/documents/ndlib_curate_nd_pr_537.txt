View OSF Archive ingest jobs
Adds the admin ability to see the status of all batch ingest jobs. Summary of changes:  Added controller/routes/view for handling /admin/batch_ingest, with optional filter params on job name and status BatchIngestor was primarily used for puts of data to the Batch Ingest System, so methods such as initialize and error handling required data for those types of actions. We now need methods for doing simpler things such as gets of the /jobs from the system, so I had to refactor some of these common methods to be a bit more generic. Removed extraneous routes for ingest_osf_archives
