Try splitting our test suite
I keep encountering failed CI runs because travis timed out because the tests took too long. I'd like to try splitting our test suite into "unit" and "integration" parts and run them in parallel. This is what PSU does, and it's also one of the things Travis recommends for speeding up the build:  Integration tests (right now, just our feature tests) are the longer-running individually, but there are fewer of them. We could put more things in the "integration" set of tests to even things out a bit more, and maybe also put the yarn tests in a separate run (right now the yarn tests are running twice... once with unit and once with integration). Hard to get an exact apples-to-apples time comparison but best case I think this takes our build from ~34 minutes to ~26, with more room for improvement. Fixes #1272 Edit: I split out rubocop and js (yarn) into their own parallel runs too. Now our run time is down even further.
