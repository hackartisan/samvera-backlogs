Feature/fedora timeout patch
The error Faraday::TimeoutError: Net::ReadTimeout described in #867 seems to be occurring when active-fedora takes a longer to start than the default timeout that Faraday is allowed to wait. Allowing an extended/custom timeout in fedora.yml has already been addressed in this PR samvera/active_fedora#1271, but apparently, it hasn't been released yet. There is some discussion regarding this update in this ticket: samvera/active_fedora#1105 config/initializers/active_fedora_timeout_monkey_patch.rb is a temporary patch for now until the update active_fedora PR#1271 gets released.
