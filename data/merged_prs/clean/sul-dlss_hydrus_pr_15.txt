Dev updates
This represents mostly unavoidable work at keeping dependencies up to date and tests well formed.  However, it does not resolve all problems with integration tests.  Major updates include:  rails 3.2.19 to 3.2.21 rspec 2 to rspec 3 capistrano moab-versioning nokogiri dor-services equivalent-xml -- start tracking it and update  The best ways to run tests include: RAILS_ENV=test rspec --tag ~integration RAILS_ENV=test rspec --tag integration Keep rake out of it.  Make the target ENV explicit.  You can also run individual spec files this way by appending them to the command. The code in this state does pass all non-integration (~integration) tests.  But it fails 64 integration tests.  This is less than when I started out. Recommended that ANY development work start from here rather than diverge.
