use older version of blacklight_range_limit gem
This fixes a bug where the following AJAX request was failing when trying to load the range limit facet:  The latest version of blacklight_range_limit uses Blacklight.default_index.connection.get while our version of blacklight uses Blacklight.solr.get. This was causing a no method error. projectblacklight/blacklight_range_limit@50100dc#diff-a7da87e4125dfb8355fafe37687e74deL46
