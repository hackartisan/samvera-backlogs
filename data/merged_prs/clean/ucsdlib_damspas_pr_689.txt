Title sorting ignores quotes and case
Fixes #661 MERGED NOTE: There will need to be an accompanying PR against dams4-solr with these schema.xml changes. I haven't put that up yet, because I'd like feedback from the team on this approach before doing so. This will require a full reindex, so we want to get this right the first time, ideally.. Local Checklist   Tests written and passing locally?  Code style checked?  QA-ed locally?  Rebased with master branch?  Configuration updated (if needed)?  Documentation updated (if needed)?  What does this PR do?  creates an alphaStrippedSort fieldtype which ignores double quotes/single quotes, and parens (for now), and filters case-sensitivity explicitly declares title_ssi as a field of type alphaStrippedSort for use in sorting instead of the default tokenizer/filters applied when analyzing title_ssi adds a test verifying the results illustrated in the attached screenshot  Why are we doing this? Any context of related work? References #661 Screenshots  /developers - please review
