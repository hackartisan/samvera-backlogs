Improve management of elevated privileges in CurateND
Move Repo manager from yml file to database @03f92ab219ff370940c2443d3c853161ea259782 Deferring repo_manager routes to Curate @016ffa72ff7fdf07c59ba865550e0c9667e76b57 Adding data_migrator gem @45cd332b9a62671f43604d6718e551542eca6c2a Given that we are beginning to configure administrators in the database, I want a way to manage that migration in a predictable manner. Adding data migration as part of deploy @22e2697a18d3d9d235f1c1ea4ef905e4629bc1b9 Adding RepoManager data migration @4b7f0ff52af817ff3ab45240d982a61093de28b3  I want this data to be loaded based on the YAML file that has been included. This is a one time migration. At a future point, we will need to remove the secrets configuration file from which that Repo Manager is derived.  Closes #227
