Creating persisters that allow for singular, since it works for us
Description I was walking down the path of making everything plural and then I got to the part where we were outputting our data and realized it really needed to be singular there.  That meant we would need to translate from plural to singular.  That got me thinking why translate at the outside of the system.  Why not do the translation at the persistence layer? I brought that thought to refactoring and we took it a step further.  What would happen if we just allowed Singular to  work.  The result is a set of persister that do not check for multiple. This made almost every test pass, except for the few that relied on the new parameter new_record. I'm not entirely positive this is what we want to do, or if we want to create an "Saveable" object that translates any singular property into multiple before it is saved.
