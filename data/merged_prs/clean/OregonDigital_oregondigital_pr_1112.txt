Feature/upgrade rails 4 2 x
closes #1037 This should be staged if at all possible.  The things which caused problems don't really make sense to have broken, at least based on the Rails guide about upgrading from 4.1 to 4.2. This PR includes the docker PR commits because I needed those to get anywhere.  The docker PR, #1111, should be merged first so this PR doesn't clobber that one, and so the two features are clearly separated. The loss of test coverage is almost definitely due to the inclusion of the blacklight helper.  This file had to be copied in to alter how it handled the Solr document when rendering related links in the page header due to a change in the Rails polymorphic URL insanity.
