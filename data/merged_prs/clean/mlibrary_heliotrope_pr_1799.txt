…rwise fall back to the "cached" versions. This is a temporary step towards removing the "cache" completely. The intention is have both "unpack" and "cache" code paths released into production. The "unpack" code path is triggered if there's an epub or webgl derivative path (an upacked asset in ./tmp/derivatives). All epubs and webgl derivatives can be created with the rake heliotrope:unpack_assets rake task which kicks off UnpackJobs. This is currently deployed on both staging and testing Then we'll work on removing the "cache" code from the code base for the next production release. See #1692
