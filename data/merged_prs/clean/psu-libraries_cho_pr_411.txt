Remote authentication and access
Description References ticket: #350 Incorporates the devise_remote gem into Cho so we can allow specific users access to the application. I'd like to review this a bit more and then squash some commits. The LdapUser class was copied from Scholarsphere and might be able to be moved into another gem such as LdapDisambiguate. Why was this necessary? We need to limit who is allowed to use Cho. Changes  Run the devise_remote installer Enable remote authentication with Cosign Limit access to users in the cho-admin Ldap group  Checklist   i18n enabled  adequate test coverage  accessible interface
