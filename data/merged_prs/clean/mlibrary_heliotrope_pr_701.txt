Story #673 Refactored the test setup on some specs to speed up the specs
For test setup, create the Monograph, Section, and FileSet records in let blocks instead of creating them by interacting with the UI in the body of the spec.  (Avoid extra routing and rendering work to speed up the spec.)   For specs that don't need admin-level access, don't log in with any user.  (This change isn't for performance, but just to remove unnecessary code.  You shouldn't have to be an admin user to view the facets.)   On my laptop (without spring running), the specs in this file took about 38 seconds to run.  After these changes, they took about 27 seconds.
