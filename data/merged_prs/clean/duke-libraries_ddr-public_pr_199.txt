Hotfixes for range filter historgram, ssl error, and thumbnail helper; closes #198
I deployed this branch to pre and verified that it fixes the SSL error when viewing a component that has a multires image. Example:  This branch also disables the histogram feature of the range limit gem to prevent the broken pipe error in the histogram's ajax request. Example:  I refactored the thumbnail tag helper that was breaking on items without components. It's now agnostic about the type of document being displayed and just checks whether a multires_image_file_path (or multires_image_file_paths) is available on a document or any of that document's children. There isn't a collection deployed to pre that can verify this fix, but I created a collection and child item locally without any components and verified the thumbnail fix.
