adding validity display to tabs and school component
This commit displays the validity of a tab to students via icons in the tabs. When a student saves a tab, its valid property is set to true and the checked icon appears in the tab. When a user interacts with inputs in a valid tab, the tab is in a messy/dirty/invalid state and the icon disappears. This functionality has been implemented for the default inputs and school components. In the case of the school component, when the school select is interacted with, it sets the Program and Embargo tabs to invalid as well. The other components will be implemented if this approach is approved. The valid properties need to be saved so that they can be preserved across sessions, in a future commit also.
