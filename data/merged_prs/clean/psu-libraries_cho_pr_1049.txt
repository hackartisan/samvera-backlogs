Can provide representative images for collections
Description Representative images for a collection can be placed in public/collection-images. If the collection's id is "pstsc_09844", then placing an image file into that directory with the same name will pick it up. You can provide images in: jpg, jpeg, png, or gif extensions. Thus all of the following images would be valid for the aforementioned collection: public/collection-images/pstsc_09844.jpg public/collection-images/pstsc_09844.jpeg public/collection-images/pstsc_09844.png public/collection-images/pstsc_09844.gif  Please note that for sanity's sake, the collection's id is downcased before searching the filesystem. Thus a collection with id "PTSC_09844" should have an its image file downcased like so: pstsc_09844.jpg If no representative image is provided, then public/collection-images/default.png is rendered.
