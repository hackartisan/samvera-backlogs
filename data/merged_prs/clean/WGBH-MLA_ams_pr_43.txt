WIP - Create Series work type
Creates a Series work type from rails g hyrax:work Series. Modifies Series model, SeriesForm object, Series Presenter object, attribute rows partial for Series, Sets required fields to be Title and Description only. Adds PBCore specific fields. Adds ability for everyone to create Series records. Adds test for the SeriesForm object. Adds enhanced integration test for creating new Series.  Also,  Removes unused code in User factory. Fixes test for creating Asset records. Fixes typo: changes 'Annotiation' to 'Annotation'. Adds a random DateTime helper for more flexible testing on input and display of dates. Adds a wait_for helper to wait for X seconds for a block to return something truthy. This is used to wait X seconds while checking to see if a record exists before proceeding in an integration spec, and is better than hardcoding a number that may or may not be long enough, or too long. Adds pry-rails for using Pry as Rails console.  Closes AMS2-137.
