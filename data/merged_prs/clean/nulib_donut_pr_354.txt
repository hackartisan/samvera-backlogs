Adds seed data which can be ingested through batch
Fixes  nulib/next-generation-repository#642 Will create 30 Image records and 2 collection records to populate donut development environments with data for development/display in Front End (Glaze)/QC. To run:  make sure you've first run bundle exec rake s3:setup run bin/import_from_s3 dev-batch seed-data.csv  After that you can monitor progress/ingest errors in donut here:  Caveats:  This will take a bit of time to run - about 45 minutes to run on my dev machine The two collections it creates are Private (restricted) - you must go in manually and save them as  Institution (authenticated) or Open (public) in order to see them on the front end. (And add thumbnails if you desire.)
