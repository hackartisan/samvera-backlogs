Tasks to force migration on handles with wrong order and invalid chars in creator field
related to #1796 Main tasks (R1 and R2) are ready to be run in sequence. Each run will fix issues described in #1796 (comment)  Task 1 (R1) can be used to migrate and fix works with creators that have the incorrect characters  bundle exec rake scholars_archive:migrate_dspace_creator_char_cleanup   Task 1 (R2) can be used to migrate and fix creators that have incorrect order for including creators with 10+ items  bundle exec rake scholars_archive:migrate_dspace_creator_order_cleanup   Task 2 was used to separate those works that  already had fixed. The task  was useful to build groups X and Y. It also gave me the counts in #1796 (comment)  bundle exec rake scholars_archive:get_json_of_handles_to_be_fixed_excluding_works_manually_fixed   Task 3 was used to get the final list of handles that need to be fixed. They generate csvs for each group listed in #1796 (comment) These are required for Task 1  bundle exec rake scholars_archive:get_all_handles_to_be_fixed   Task 4 was used to get handles that belong to works with new or updated creators since migration (part of group W as described in #1796 (comment)). Task 4 only covers those works that overlap with group Y (Unknown char ‘?’ issue in #1796 (comment))  bundle exec rake scholars_archive:find_creators_with_additional_changes_w1   Task 5 was also used to get handles that belong to works with new or updated creators since migration. Task 5 only covers those works that overlap with group Z (Works with 10+ creators issue in #1796 (comment))  bundle exec rake scholars_archive:find_creators_with_additional_changes_w2
