Generate sitemaps on a schedule, not on deploy
While working with  on getting capistrano to restart damsolrizer, I realized that the capistrano task to generate sitemaps is taking between 3-5+ minutes on deploys. Given that the overall time for a deploy is between 7-8 minutes, we're spending a significant percentage, in some cases I clocked it at taking up 80% of the total time. And the, more important, reality is that updating a sitemap is about content, not about things that are generally deployment related. We went months without a damspas deploy, and yet DOMM added tons of new objects. I think a better solution is to put the production environment on a schedule to keep the sitemap up to date. Resulting crontab will look like: ~/projects/ucsd/damspas (feature/sitemap-production-only) % docker-compose -f docker/dev/docker-compose.yml exec web whenever RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT=/dc  0 * * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'cd /usr/src/app && RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake aeon_requests:process_new --silent'  0 0 * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'cd /usr/src/app && RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake aeon_requests:revoke_old --silent'  0 2 * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'cd /usr/src/app && RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake sitemap:refresh --silent'  ## [message] Above is your schedule file converted to cron syntax; your crontab file was not updated. ## [message] Run `whenever --help' for more options.
