Set visibility private for hidden objects
When an object is marked "hidden" set its visibility to private. When it is unhidden, set visibility back to open. Also apply hidden visibility to attached file sets. Fixes #1408 Fixes #303  This is the solution we talked about today. I think it's not great that "un-hiding" a work sets it and its files back to "open", but I'm hoping it's good enough for now. Can we just explain that if you decide to "un-hide" something, but you still want to embargo part of it, you'll need to go set the embargo separately?
