Use the FileSet ID for the pyramid TIFF location and IIIF ID
fixes nulib/next-generation-repository#760 fixes nulib/next-generation-repository#718  Creates a public route for manifests and adds url to Elasticsearch index. Ex: "iiif_manifest": ""  Manifests are shown for Public/NetId works only - but each manifest will contain ALL FileSets (including private ones)   Uses file_set.id instead of the file id (file_set.files.first.id) to name the pyramidal .tif location to get around the issue of the file id not being available at index time. Adds sidekiq to development dependencies so that functionality that depends on async jobs can be adequately tested.  Jobs will still run inline by default. If you want to use sidekiq:  In development.local.yml, add/change:      active_job:   queue_adapter: :sidekiq   Then start sidekiq (in separate tab) bundle exec sidekiq  IMPORTANT - Deployments need to correspond with this PR on the front end: nulib/next-gen-front-end-react#192 and existing Pyramidal .tif's on S3 will need to be renamed.
