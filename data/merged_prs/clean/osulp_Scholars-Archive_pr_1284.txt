added scholars archive shares behavior to handle template not found
fixes #1283  We are adding a Scholars Archive behavior for SharesController, which includes custom_redirect custom_redirect could be used to prevent a template-not-found error for dashboard/shares path for now (We are redirecting from dashboard/shares to dashboard/my/works, which is the default path for regular users) A related issue has been reported in hyrax here samvera/hyrax#2767 Once hyrax/issues/2767 is resolved, we can remove the custom_redirect and ScholarsArchive::MySharesBehavior as well if not needed in the end
