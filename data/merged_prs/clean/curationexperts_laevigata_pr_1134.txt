Add webpacker and Vue
This commit adds webpacker and Vue to the codebase. Webpacker is a way of managing front-end assets. Vue is a progressive JS framework that is designed to be incrementally adoptable. Additional applications need to be installed in the dev env after this commit. You will need to install yarn, a JS package manager similar to gem. On a Mac you can install it like this: brew install yarn On other systems you can install it though npm: npm install -g yarn When running the dev env you will need to have the webpack-dev-server running in another tab: bin/webpack-dev-server
