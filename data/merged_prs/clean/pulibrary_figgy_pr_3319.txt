Bump handlebars from 4.0.12 to 4.1.2
Bumps handlebars from 4.0.12 to 4.1.2.  Changelog Sourced from handlebars's changelog.  v4.1.2 - April 13th, 2019 Chore/Test:  #1515 - Port over linting and test for typings (@â€‹zimmi88) chore: add missing typescript dependency, add package-lock.json - 594f1e3 test: remove safari from saucelabs - 871accc  Bugfixes:  fix: prevent RCE through the "lookup"-helper - cd38583  Compatibility notes: Access to the constructor of a class thought {{lookup obj "constructor" }} is now prohibited. This closes a leak that only half closed in versions 4.0.13 and 4.1.0, but it is a slight incompatibility. This kind of access is not the intended use of Handlebars and leads to the vulnerability described in #1495. We will not increase the major version, because such use is not intended or documented, and because of the potential impact of the issue (we fear that most people won't use a new major version and the issue may not be resolved on many systems). Commits v4.1.1 - March 16th, 2019 Bugfixes:  fix: add "runtime.d.ts" to allow "require('handlebars/runtime')" in TypeScript - 5cedd62  Refactorings:  replace "async" with "neo-async" - 048f2ce use "substring"-function instead of "substr" - 445ae12  Compatibility notes:  This is a bugfix release. There are no breaking change and no new features.
