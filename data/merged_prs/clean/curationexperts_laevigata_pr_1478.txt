When displaying active embargoes search only Etd embargoes
The purpose of this filter is to avoid showing FileSet/File embargoes when showing the embargo index. The normal reason to view the embargo index is to edit embargoes from the dashboard. In the usual case for this application we don't want users editing embargoes for FileSets/Files, since these are meant to be derived from the embargo on the Etd. Indeed, we can safely consider file embargoes to be "behind the scenes"; they have more to do with permission management than user facing funcionality. To avoid confusion, we simply decline to list these embargoes in the index view. If additional, non-Etd work types are added, this may need to be updated to filter in a different way. Closes #1404.
