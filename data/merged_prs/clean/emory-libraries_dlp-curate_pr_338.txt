Database migrations should always run on cap deploy
Running a cap deploy should always include running database migrations; Otherwise, we could get into a state where the database schema and the software do not align. I do not know what this line was trying to do: Rake::Task["migrate"].clear_actions But removing it restores the expected db:migrate task during a cap deploy: bess@paz: (master):~/projects/dlp-curate$ cap qa deploy | grep migrate 00:42 deploy:migrate       [deploy:migrate] Run `rake db:migrate`       01 bundle exec rake db:migrate  Connected to curationexperts#21
