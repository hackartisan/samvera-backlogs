Remove unnecessary links to authority checks
Working toward the goals of  this PR:  removes authority-conditional deposit links in deposit menu, and replaces them with direct links. The included links are open to all, so the authority checks were unnecessary. deletes the authority-conditional "edit" link on the catalog page. Edit is still available on each individual show page. remove redundant authority checks while finding the thumbnail link. The actual access via downloads_controller also handles authorization. remove attempt to find person name for creator facet. The creator is not a pid, so this would have never succeeded.
