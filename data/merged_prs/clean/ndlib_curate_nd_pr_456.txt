386 doi minting text unclear
Claiming issue 386 @912c09f7f73bc98a54531068d20e81baa5349973 relates to #386 $ ./script/start-issue 386 [skip ci] Update DOI minting process @c83ba22b7ab8d490ea46aa9ea7801074bb97b310 Modify text to be more clear. Break publisher requirement with DOI. Add CurateND as publisher for all DOI minting requests. Verified that I18n.t('sufia.product_name') resolves to "CurateND" in rails console. Jeremy and I were unable to set up a test for the mapping in a reasonable timeframe. Change DOI publisher to "University of Notre Dame" @117777f5880e8e60b80ffc7407a3746cfdf0fb41 Closing issue 386 @778318a2b346739e49d75582a79b9dbd1e415e2b Closes #386 $ ./script/close-issue 386
