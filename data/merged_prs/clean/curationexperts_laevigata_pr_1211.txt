Add testing and linting for scripts in app/javascript
This commit sets up tesing and linting for the code in app/javascript. The tests can be run with  yarn test and linting can be run with yarn lint. Testing is done with  and can be used with modern JS modules, Vue Single File Components, or plain JS. There is an inital test in app/javascript/test/app.spec.js that can be used as a reference. The assertions that be made are documented here:  The travis build will run yarn test. Linting is done with the standard js style:  Travis is not running yarn lint yet. There will need to be some clean up of the exisiting code before making that part of the build process if we want to make it part of the build process. Related to #1181
