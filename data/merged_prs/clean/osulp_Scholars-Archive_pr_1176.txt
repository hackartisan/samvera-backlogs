Includes recaptcha for the contact page
Fixes #378 This includes the recaptcha v2 from google via a rails gem. The rails gem manages all the javascripts and makes it extremely easy to configure and include keys via a rails esque way of programming. This is my proposed fix for SA to get it in here. Changing this for inclusion in Hyrax could be a pain in the butt so I figure this would probably be best to push up now. My proposed fix for hyrax would be to set this up with flip flop to turn this captcha on and off but including it this way, using the rails gem might not be the way they want to go. Id much rather propose this fix to them and if it gets accepted in, then we can remove this code from SA and use hyrax to manage it instead.
