Use FITS Servlet
This commit allows you to use an external FITS Servlet for file characterization. To turn it on, set the 'FITS_SERVLET_URL' environment varible on your server before starting the server. This is accomplished with overrides and prepends, so it won't be possible for a FlipFlop feature to toggle this, because you will need to restart your server. The FITS servlet URL should be the full path to the FITS endpoint. In the docker-compose environment this is at  and the specs are run using the external fits servlet. On travis, the default FITS behavior (using the local version) is used. If the FITS_SERVLET_URL is not set, the server will use the default FITS installation. Connected to CAL-580
