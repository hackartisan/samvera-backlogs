Index EDTF dates as Solr DateRangeField
Description Parse EDTF dates and expand them to a Solr DateRangeField to allow them to appear in searches for a date that they contain. TODO:  I've not figured out how to make Blacklight use this new field in the searches (I want to use date_created_dtrsim but it is using date_created_tesim) Still need to handle EDTF Sets? Uncertain dates are currently "exploded" to +/-1 least-significant-digit, which is how machinist tolerances are defined. Make this configurable at runtime?  Connected to #726 Changes  Reformat EDTF dates into the respective syntax for Solr DateRangeField  Certain dates of varying precision Uncertain dates of varying precision Unspecified dates of varying precision Intervals with any combination of the above   New indexer to add this field to a solr document if necessary New class to help abstract out the solr fields used by Blacklight's search bar
