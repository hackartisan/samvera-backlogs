Because a Book may not have a :creator it will no longer be required (Books will probably have an :author instead). :type is now required for Document because it can change the available form fields.

Since we only have one input mask to start it isn't a big deal. Fixing typo in CSS class name @e568a1e1cf5045d181830375ef984fd31dcd6671 Reusing toggle function for event and non-event contexts @8971383fa4b0bd060cd9c4acf74202e5e0131323 formInputMask widget documentation; conditional field display @d4ccc7d36f6d5f6551b1ac4475db537a30d46fc8 Instructions on initialization and clarifying comments on intent. Form fields with a value that would normally be hidden by an input mask are shown anyway. Applying an input mask does not clear form field values so. Before this change it would be possible to submit an attribute that will be persisted and displayed that is not shown on the form. This is confusing. Changed conditional formatting as recommended by jshint. The event object passed to toggleTypedInputFieldsHandler is ALREADY a jQuery object. Re-casting it caused val function to return undefined.
