Restructure partials
Refactors the representative viewer partials:  Combine partials to make logic controlling view of representatives more intuitive. Rename the new iiif_representative_viewer back to representative_viewer. Move the iiif-related code away from the main logic of the partial, and into the image-only section.  Also deletes several obsolete work-specific show views. To send new file types to the iiif viewer:  change class work-representation to iiif-work-representation surround section for image type by <div class="image-viewer-integration" data-manifest-url="<%= manifest_url_for(id: work.pid) %>"> ... </div>   add <div class="spinner"></div> within above div
