adds kakadu, rais (iiif), a service to make images work with UV and rais
fixes #54 ref #30 This adds RAIS (without S3 integration) to the development/test stack, adds an OD FileSetDerivativesService to generate jp2's for tiffs and fullsize jpg's for other image types. Generates valid IIIF urls for RAIS to serve the images up using Universal Viewer. I couldn't find a great way to access the files directly on Fedora which is why full sized derivatives are being created.. This may make sense, in so much as the original files are stored in the backend (currently fedora) and RAIS has access to jp2 or full size jpg. Let's discuss. See the screenshot with a gif, 2 png, 2 jpg, and a tiff original files.. The tiff was transcoded to a jp2 and the other files to full sized jpgs.
