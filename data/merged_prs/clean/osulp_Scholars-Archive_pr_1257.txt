Adds in smarter validation for unrequired fields
This is my proposition for fixing the unrequired issue for degree grantors. It allows for the extension of unrequired fields beyond just PurchasedEResources. If a record has this behavior, and responds to the method, then it'll make decisions based on whether the field is nil or empty. If so, it'll skip it, if it has a value, then it'll validate that value is correct.
