Display the supplemental files on the ETD edit form.  Part of story #1445.
When editing an ETD that I have previously submitted, the supplemental files that I previously attached to my ETD will be displayed on the edit form, along with the button to add more supplemental files. There is a 'Remove' button next to each supplemental file in the list, so I can delete any of the supplemental files. For supplemental files that were already attached to the ETD, I won't be able to edit the metadata fields (inputs will be disabled).  But if I upload a new supplemental file, I can enter metadata for that new file. (Note: Currently that new metadata won't be persisted when you hit the submit button.  This is a known problem.  I will follow up later with a separate PR for that problem.) Connected to #1445
