500 insufficient guards against nil on collection search splash
Claiming issue 500 @b282af32686cd6d05b29f46fb9f5f9b257ba3b51 relates to #500 $ ./script/start-issue 500 [skip ci] Adding fallback for SearchSplash presenter @5b7c1a111188a00c286bcd0ea55ff61ad6f23721 There are two solutions:  What happens when the nested ifs don't find a hit. By default return a nil titled object. What happens for filtering on Collection via an f_inclusive. Return a Struct.new(:title).new("Collections") object.  Based on the splash page, this appears to be a reasonable solution. Closing issue 500 @38e2971b540bd51202225d4e0b1a4af615160316 Closes #500 $ ./script/close-issue 500
