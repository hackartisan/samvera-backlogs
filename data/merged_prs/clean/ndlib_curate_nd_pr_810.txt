Api bug fixes
Fixes several identified bugs in the curate api.  Make sure a user name shows in dropdown list for token creation. Select current user for token creation dropdown, since this is the most likely person to be selecting. Fix itemUrl. Parse input parameters so entry is consistent for "OR" search options. (type=Article,Image is now the valid syntax for selecting multiple work types)  Still remaining: the download thumbnail url did not work via curl, but appears to work the browser. (Not sure why it shows the performance-related commits here... I already rebased master into the curate_api branch, so these should already be incorporated there.)
