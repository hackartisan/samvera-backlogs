Correct searchability and facetability of metadata
Fixes #272 and Fixes #397 This PR adds a new option to metadata advance_search which is recognized in the catalog controller. It also brings the metadata searchability (advanced and simple) and facetability in-line with the MAP (again). The notable exceptions being date_modified and date_uploaded because that is Core Metadata and un-editable yet. Also and exception, original_filename as it is not configured yet. Not setting advance_search will default the metadata's searchability to whether it is indexed as :stored_searchable for both advanced and simple search. Setting advance_search to true (and indexing as :stored_searchable) will only allow the metadata to be searched if the exact field is specified (&search_field=cover_description&q=<query>). Setting advance_search to false will only allow the metadata to be searched in simple (all_fields) search.
