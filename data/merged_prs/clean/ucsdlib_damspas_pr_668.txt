vrr: support revoking in NewRightsProcessor
The previous implementation did not actually test revoking via the nightly rake task. Examples being:  Assuming in initialize that the attributes were based on a Hashie:Mash class or subclass, which Aeon::Request is, but is not what was provided in revoke_old (was just a simple hash that would blow up immediately when called with messages like .email..) The work_pid would never be found in initialize because subLocation would not exist in the request attributes supplied by revoke_old  Fixes #667 Local Checklist   Tests written and passing locally?  Code style checked?  QA-ed locally?  Rebased with master branch?  Configuration updated (if needed)?  Documentation updated (if needed)?  What does this PR do? Hopefully gets the vrr/aeon nightly revoke_old task to actually work. Why are we doing this? Any context of related work? References #667 - We're doing this because Notch8 did not test this codepath or write tests for it. Where should a reviewer start? Take a look at the test I wrote. There ended up being a few issues, as illustrated in the commit message. This exercises those issues (needing a Hashie::Mash instance or subclass instance, not setting the work_pid from a location that wouldn't exist in this context, etc.) Manual testing steps? We definitely need to test this on staging w/ real records, we currently have 9 that should expire, so that should work well. We also need to make sure this doesn't introduce any regressions, which is theoretically possible since we don't have great test coverage with this work. /developers - please review
