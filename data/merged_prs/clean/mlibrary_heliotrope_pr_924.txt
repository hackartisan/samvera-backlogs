Resolves #879 Adds fields for primary editor first and last name
We need to differentiate editors from "creators"/authors. Because of how rdf works, we can't rely on order in the monograph.editor field. So, like with "creator" we create first and last name fields for the "primary_editor" and put the first editor in them, with remaining editors in the (unordered) "editor" list. This doesn't yet work with the importer, manual editing would need to happen after importing a new monograph with multiple editors. Because editors are not used in file_sets, we don't include this in a construct like the "stores_creator_name_seperately.rb" file. We just put the fields in the monograph model. Right now the only use case is a book with 2 editors. When we get to 3, and if order matters, we'll need to come up with something else...
