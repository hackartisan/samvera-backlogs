Handle `InProgressEtd::NO_EMBARGO` values in the actor stack
The PregradEmbargo actor is responsible for setting up attributes for a six-year pregraduation embargo when an embargo_length is passed during Etd creation. This works more or less the same as its predecessor, but relies more on base Hyrax behavior. The values passed here are eventually interpreted at graduation time to determine the post-grad embargo release date. However, the InProgressEtd data stores a specific string indicating that no embargo is requested and passes that value to the stack. This is always interpreted as a request for a pregrad embargo. Ideally, we would handle this at the edge of InProgressEtd so other parts of the application don't need to be aware of this blessed string. It's likely that InProgressEtd needs this to be round-tripabble, and the handling for transformation of this data lives across various methods. Rather than attempt an immediate refactor, we fix the bug by handling the special data in the actor stack. We raise a warning so the larger fix won't get ignored. Fixes #1485.
