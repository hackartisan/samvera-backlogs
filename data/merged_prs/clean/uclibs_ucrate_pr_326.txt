Update spec for deleting non-empty collection types
Partial fix for #310 The test  was failing very frequently.  I determined that it always failed when it ran after  It turns out the test had some problems and was only passing sometimes for the wrong reasons.  The test incorrectly tried twice to delete a collection type.  That problem had since been fixed in the Hyrax version of collection_type_spec.rb.  So I updated our collection_type_spec.rb to match  You can replicate the failure on the develop branch by running bundle exec rspec ./spec/features/collection_multi_membership_spec.rb[1:2:2:1:1] ./spec/features/collection_type_spec.rb[1:4:2:1] --seed 17037 If you then switch to this branch and run the same two tests again, you shouldn't get any failures.
