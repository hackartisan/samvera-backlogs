Fix expiration service spec
Partial fix for #310 The test spec/services/expiration_service_spec.rb:38 frequently fails when we run the test suite.  The failure occurs when spec/features/embargo_spec.rb:15 runs before the expiration_service_spec.  The embargo_spec leaves behind an embargoed work that causes expiration_service_spec to find the wrong work. The failure can be reproduced on develop using this bundle exec rspec spec/features/embargo_spec.rb[1:1:1] spec/services/expiration_service_spec.rb[1:3:1] --seed 63688  I fixed it by adding a :clean_repo to the expiration_service_spec so the test starts with no existing works in Fedora.  Running the command above with the fix in place allows all tests to pass.
