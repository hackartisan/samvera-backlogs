Fix iiif url syntax for initial request
It's been bothering me that when I generated a list of URLs for  the URLs as produced by the system didn't work (in spite of the fact that universal viewer works fine). There was a mistake in the iiif URL, which this PR fixes. This also logs the request (at debug level) for easier problem diagnosis and performance measurement down the road.
