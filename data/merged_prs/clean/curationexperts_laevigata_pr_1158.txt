Revert nvarchar
Postgres will never make it to the migration that changes the data type from nvarchar to varchar since it errors out on the initial reference to nvarchar in the earlier migration.  This means we have to more completely revert the change.  I have left my entire commit history (unsquashed) so folks can review the exact process I used - I'm happy to squash, but it seemed like keeping the history of the individual steps might be useful. Connected to #1153 Connected to #1149 - I've deployed this branch successfully to  DEVELOPER NOTES For folks who have already run the migrations on their local machine, I added a commit that makes the final column change reversible (it wasn't previously).  You should be able to get back to a working state by checking out master once this is merged: git checkout f3e8a4617a887 bin/rails db:rollback STEP=2 git checkout master bin/rails db:migrate
