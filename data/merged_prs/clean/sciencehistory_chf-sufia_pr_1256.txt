Audio playlist on item display page.
Will close #1231  Show an audio playlist above the representative display -- practically speaking at the top left of the page, or at the very top on narrow screens. If you are logged in, you will also see the regular audio tags below the main item display. Otherwise, they will be hidden; your only way to interact with audio will be through this playlist. Show the download links only for the selected track, per Hillary.  TODO:   Get rid of the grey background around the audio tag.  The audio tag should be as wide as possible.  Rename viewable_audio_member_presenters to a more helpful method name  Merge _media_player.html.erb and _media_item.html.erb .  show_thumb_member_presenters should filter out audio unless the user is staff.  Investigate mysterious and probably unnecessary changes to _show_page_image.html.  Move the CSS to a new playlist.scss file in app/assets/stylesheets/local/, where it will get picked up by  @import "local/**/*"; in sufia.scss  Convert track list table to an actual HTML list  Edit front-end tests  Edit CSS to work well on narrow phone display  Automatically play the next track when you get to the end of a track
