Store research field names and ids
Fixes #309 The terms and ids have switched in the service and tests. This is necessary to look up a field's code by the name of the field. Because of this, the helper and renderer can be removed, and we don't need to look up labels for tests. Now, we need the service's #select_all_ids method, so the dropdown shows and stores the names of the research fields. The model validates three or fewer fields, as per #188, but does not address marking one of them as primary. The research_field_id attribute is set when the ETD is saved, looking up the fields' codes at that time. The predicate for research_field_id is the temporary one given by Emily, who will be out until Tuesday. The predicate for research_field is DC11 instead of dcterms. Changing the fields to the ones given by ProQuest (#292) will happen separately, as I think ProQuest gave us a bad file.
