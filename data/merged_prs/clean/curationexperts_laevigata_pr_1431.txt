displaying next incomplete tab based on saved completion status
This commit adds some code to the create and beforeMounted Vue lifecycle hooks to find out which tab is the last valid saved one. Each tab has a step property, an integer. When a tab is validated on the backend, its step property is returned to the front end as 'currentStep' and is accessible from the formStore's savedData. When the form loads now, in its create hook it checks the savedData for a defined 'currentStep', and if it doesn't find one, displays the form in its default beginning state, with the first tab enabled. If it finds a currentStep, it enables all tabs whose step property is less than or equal to itself, and displays the tab whose step property equals itself plus 1.
