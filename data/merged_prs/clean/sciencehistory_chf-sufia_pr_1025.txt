Feature to log out admin logins while leaving public app up
Implemented super cheesy hacky.  Hook into a devise feature meant for user 'activation' to let all users not login be even meaner to devise by using some hacky ruby/rails craziness to tell it not to present the usual login screen if we have logins disabled.  If we set logins to be disabled, and a logged in user accesses the app, they will be immediately logged out. If they were trying to do something that required a login, they'll be redirected to the 'login' screen, which has been replaced with a message actually saying "Sorry, logins disabled." They'll have to login again when logins are no longer disabled. If they never accessed the app when logins were disabled, they'll find themselves still logged in after the window though. But if they acccess during window, they'll get logged out and have to log in again. Closes #1014
