Quick Accessibility Fix with Form For and ID
Swaps form_with back to form_for to get the label and input ids to match. Description Using the new form_with does not automatically generate the ID for the input and when I use the same symbol from the label element to explicitly set the ID it doesn't prepend the value with the collection type. References ticket: (if any) #386 Why was this necessary? In order to gain greater accessibility with form controls and labels, the  value of the for attribute and the id need to match. Changes Swaps form_with to be form_for instead Are there any major changes in this PR that will change the release process? No Checklist   i18n enabled  adequate test coverage  accessible interface
