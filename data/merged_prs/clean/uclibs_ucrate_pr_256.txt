Reopened visibility file from the engine, updated default to public.
Refactor using the re-opening technique, instead of using whole file. Added tests for create work and batch create works. Comply with rubocop. Provide explicit conversion of path to string. Path figured out, tests working? Add method guard, fix test for batch create spec. Fixes #250 ; Changed the visibility method so that it defaults to open rather than private. # frozen_string_literal: true  require "pathname" visibility_path = Pathname.new(Gem.loaded_specs['hydra-access-controls'].full_gem_path + '/app/models/concerns/hydra/access_controls/visibility.rb') require visibility_path module Hydra::AccessControls   module Visibility     def visibility       return AccessRight::VISIBILITY_TEXT_VALUE_PUBLIC if id.nil?       if read_groups.include?
