Import a Collection record from the CSV
Added a CollectionRecordImporter class that will be used (instead of the existing ActorRecordImporter) to create or update Collection records.   The new CollectionRecordImporter needed to use the same overridden find_existing_record method that the ActorRecordImporter uses, so I pulled that method into a module that is included in both classes.   Added a RecordImporter class that will act as a wrapper to select and use the correct type of record importer class for each record.   In the CalifornicaMapper, I changed the rights_statement to be an array, as it properly should be.  In the past we could be sloppy about that because the actor stack will cast it to an array.
