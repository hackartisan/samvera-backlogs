Allow repository resets in selected service environments
Description Cleaning out the repository and running benchmarks is a common task for specific environments. However, it should only be allowed in specific ones, for example, only in QA or local and not in production. Why was this necessary? This makes running benchmarks and resetting the QA environment an easier process. Changes Are there any major changes in this PR that will change the release process? Yes, we need to add a new key to the server's application.yml file. Checklist   i18n enabled  adequate test coverage  accessible interface
