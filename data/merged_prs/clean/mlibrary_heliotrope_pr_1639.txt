Resolves #1541: Restrict the Gabii EPUB
This branch has been deployed to staging for your testing convenience. The EPUB under this monograph:  is a component of the "Gabii Instituion" product and is being leased by institution "1" which is the ann arbor campus.  Hence you should be able to view the EPUB without logging into Fulcrum on staging. The EPUB under this monograph:  is a component of the "Gabii Friends" product and is being leased by "" which is me!  Hence you should not be able to view the EPUB even after logging into Fulcrum on staging.  In fact, when you try to view the EPUB you should be redirected to the CoSign login.  After logging in you'll be returned to the monograph page.  If you attempt to read the EPUB now you'll be redirect to the lessee's page (a page that list all the current lessees of the EPUB) and should see my name listed. Now that you are logged in goto the Fulcrum dashboard and click on "Lessees" in the column on the left.  Add yourself as a lessee by clicking "Add+" and entering your email address.  After your record is created you'll be able to lease the "Gabii Friends" product.  Now when you go back to the appropriate monograph you'll be able to read the EPUB. Note: When not logged in you'll see the number "1" where your email would be when logged in.  If you are connecting via the LIT network you'll also see "490" in the drop down.  Don't know what the number will be if you are connecting via the PUB network but it shouldn't be "490". P.S.  This is first iteration barebones functionality so if you got ideas on how things should be just write up a story card with your thoughts and get the conversation started. -Greg Aside:  Currently there is some after deploy stuff that needs to be done to point to the keycard database.  Noah is aware of this and is making changes to keycard to make deployment easier.  Until then just slack me if you are not seeing the number "1" where your email would prior to logging in.
