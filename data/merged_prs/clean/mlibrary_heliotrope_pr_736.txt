Revert "Merge pull request #708 from mlibrary/cc_1.7.0"
This reverts commit 16a13a3, reversing changes made to 91c4fc0. If a work was created before the introduction of CC 1.7.0/sipity workflows, apparently this error can happen after updating to CC 1.7.0: I, [2017-01-27T14:02:48.047912 #23564]  INFO -- : Started GET "/concern/monographs/zs25x856m/show" for 141.211.43.239 at 2017-01-27 14:02:48 -0500  ...

I guess every work (so Monograph or Section) needs an entry in the sipity_entites table. I thought that wasn't the case, but I guess it is, or can be? Need to investigate more before updating to CC 1.7.0.
