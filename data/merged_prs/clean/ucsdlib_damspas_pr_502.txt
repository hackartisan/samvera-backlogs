Use alpine for damspas
Fixes #501 Local Checklist   Tests written and passing locally?  QA-ed locally?  Rebased with master branch?  Configuration updated (if needed)?  Documentation updated (if needed)?  What does this PR do? Note this doesn't actually 'fix' #501, but after some research yesterday I've come to realize that while I can setup chromium and chromedriver to replace phantomjs in our Docker setup, far too many tests would need to be rewritten because we'd need to bump Capybara to a modern version. I made some effort to see how much work this would be, and it's more than seems to be of any value to us all, in my opinion. So instead I've focused on replacing the Debian-based image for local development with an Alpine based one. This cuts the overall image size for damspas from 2.2G to 650M. Which is significant.. I might be able to get it even smaller with a multi-stage build, but I think this is good for now. The two other commits are housecleaning and preparation to make the Alpine shift possible. Why are we doing this? Any context of related work? We are doing this to try and cut down on the footprint of using Docker for our local dev environment. This brings all of our images to using Alpine linux, which is the smallest starting point we can go with for now. Where should a reviewer start?  See docker/README.md changes, feedback welcome Please run the docker/dev/docker-compose.yml setup locally if you can, since we can't use it in circleci. Note that the ruby version test was changed to skip since it actually passes in the dev/non-circleci context and would then trigger an error.  Manual testing steps?  Please run the docker/dev/docker-compose.yml setup locally if you can, since we can't use it in circleci.  /developers - please review
