Adds two new models with forms and show pages working properly.
This needs to be checked out. There may be some useless files here and maybe some discussion could be had about making the views/hyrax/base/_attribute_rows partial look a bit nicer. Also the solr_document is getting a bit longer now. Im working on writing specs for these and the other models that exist in hyrax.
