Remove collection size indexing to speed up ingest CAL-581
Turn off collection size calculation during ingest This sets us up for further work moving all collection re-indexing to the end of the ingest process  Improvement so far (because re-calculating the size of a collection gets more expensive the larger the collection gets, I would expect these numbers to be more dramatically different for LADNN than they are for Bennett): Before: I, [2019-05-01T11:40:36.807328 #24190]  INFO -- : event: finish_import, batch_id: 4, successful_record_count: 80, failed_record_count: 0, elapsed_time: 1656.7904343120172, elapsed_time_per_record: 20.709880428900213 After: I, [2019-05-01T15:35:43.436054 #12308]  INFO -- : event: finish_import, batch_id: 5, successful_record_count: 80, failed_record_count: 0, elapsed_time: 1552.5210038349032, elapsed_time_per_record: 19.40651254793629
