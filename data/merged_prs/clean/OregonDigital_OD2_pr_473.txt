Remove staging
This PR is the result of a discussion between  and I regarding the merits of the application deployment to the production cluster using a previously built and tested image used on the staging cluster. Here are some benefits;  Code deployment and rollback on production should be very quick, the application image won't have to be rebuilt. Staging should behave exactly like production (from a code perspective) except using different data. Deployment to production will become an explicit action pointing at a specific application image.  Removing the Rails staging environment keeps us from having to enforce and manage parity between it and the production environment. We will, however, need to keep an eye out for behavioral differences needed by the environments and move these to the ENV. An example that comes to mind is the ability to tone down the log_level on production, or to disable SMTP on staging.
