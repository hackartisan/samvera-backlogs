Handle case where members exist, but not primary files
If a user creates an item with supplementary files but no primary files, the view would break on NoMethodError for a nil. This is because we were guarding on whether any members existed, but actually seeking a #primary? FileSet member. In leiu of a larger refactor, we add a second guard to prevent the primary file from displaying. This case would also be triggered between processing of multiple AttachFileToWorkJob jobs shortly after upload. Since the jobs are asynchronous, it's possible for a supplementary file to be attached before the primary--even when a primary file will eventually exist for the object. Closes #921.
