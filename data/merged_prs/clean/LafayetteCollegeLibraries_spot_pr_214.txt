load overrides in after_initialize block
This may not be the best way to approach overloads, but I was running into issues with a to_prepare block which changed these attributes causing a lot of strange locale translation misses. I did a lot of poking around and I think I've got it nailed down. Providing a to_prepare block to the Configuration class adds it to an array of blocks called .to_prepare_blocks which is what is iterated through when loading (see:  and  (note: the code changes in later rails versions, but the concept is the same). Something about setting one of these class attributes throws a wrench in the i18n load path, or something. When they're out, no problem, but we want them in. Finding the above code, it seems like what might be happening is our to_prepare block is coming before one that loads I18ns from the Hyrax engine (or another dependency) and hecking up something. SO, what this does is: a) loads the overrides in a lambda b) calls that lambda in the after_initialize block c) (when in development) adds the lambda to the end of the .to_prepare_blocks array, so that the next time the to_prepare blocks are called, it'll be the last one. It feels like overkill, but it's the only solution that's consistently worked so far.
