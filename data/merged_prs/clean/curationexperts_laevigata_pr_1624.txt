Better management of school, dept, and embargo state
This commit fixes some bugs in the management of the state of the properties that are based on the school. The state is based on the saved school primarily now. A copy of the school is also saved in the browser's localStorage as a precaution. This commit also adds a  destroy action to to the InProgressEtd controller, this allows for a Start Over button to be in the form that can be used by a user to delete their InProgressEtd and start over from scratch in case something goes wrong or they enter the wrong school.
