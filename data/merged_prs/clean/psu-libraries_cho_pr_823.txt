Changes to bag requirements
Description This makes some changes to the bag validation based on some feedback from  using some real world zip files for import. Additionally, files in the ingest directory are no longer cleaned out automatically with the reset task. This was causing problems with existing zip files that need to be retained for continued use. Related to #750 Changes  dates are no longer required in batch ids but will still be parsed and returned if they're in the right format access files are required for representative file sets instead of service files file sets with preservation files are no longer considered "representative" file sets the ingest directory will only be cleaned out in the test environment
