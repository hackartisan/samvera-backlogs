Autocomplete for single endpoint controlled vocabulary fields
Descriptive summary Autocomplete should work for a form field that only has one endpoint. We need to signify that a certain field is linked data and should accept a uri. Of these fields, the ones that only look to use one endpoint instead of multiple endpoints, should have autocomplete enabled. This means, when a user types into this field, it will search the endpoint for the corresponding label. It should present a dropdown with properly formatted data that when the choice is clicked, it will save the proper uri and label into the proper fields when saved. Expected behavior A user should go to a form and find a field with a single endpoint. If the user types a valid string that corresponds to a label from that endpoint, it should find that label and display it in a dropdown with other matches. The user should be able to make a choice and have the data be stored in the proper place and when the form is saved, it should save the label and uri properly.
