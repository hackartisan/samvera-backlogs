disable Apache Tika in FITS config on all californica environments
This is a known issue for Samvera (see samvera/hydra-file_characterization#25). We have observed that the majority of the CPU usage during ingest processes is in fact running FITS. We have confirmed this default configuration is in place in /opt/fits-1.3.0/xml/fits.xml This means we are currently running Apache Tika against all of our images, and Tika runs OCR. We do not need to be running OCR on our images. Changing this configuration would increase our ingest performance, and spending time running OCR on non-text images is a waste of time and resources.
