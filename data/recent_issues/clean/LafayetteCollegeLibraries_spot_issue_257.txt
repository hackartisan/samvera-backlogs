allow logins from non-admin users
when we integrated authentication with spot, we decided to limit access to only library staff (admin) status. the rationale was: a) because we're not implementing self-deposit, the current generic hyrax dashboard will be useless for a majority of our users; and b) the initial ingest does not include content that requires a lafayette login to access, so it was felt that we had some time to figure out a stop gap solution. so here's the pitch:  create a depositor role which determine whether a user can see the dashboard or not allow admins to also the see the dashboard move the else clause of the Hyrax::DashboardController to an elsif and redirect to the front page if a user isn't a depositor or admin update the log-in process to redirect to the index if the user isn't a depositor or admin (might be handled with the above update to the dashboard controller)
