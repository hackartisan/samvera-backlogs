Search out straggling delimiters
I believe in our work during Phase 1 that we came up with a list of metadata fields and the delimiters in them that we wanted to remove during ingest. There are some delimiters that persist: E.g., Bicycle racing--California $ Los Angeles  Please review previous tickets (a quick search and I couldn't find them, so it might take a while to find). And follow the pattern we established in Phase 1 The delimiters need to be removed from the current Californica records and the importer needs to be modified to apply the substitution "--" for "$" in the above example Acceptance Criteria   The subject heading above is reads: Bicycle racing--California--Los Angeles
