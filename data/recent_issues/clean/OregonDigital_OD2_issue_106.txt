Shared directory for uploads, cache, derivatives, branding images, and working files
Descriptive summary The default configurations for cache, uploads, derivatives, and working files used by Hyrax have to be set as shared storage for staging and production, but work as reasonable defaults for development.  tmp/uploads : This is used for file uploads (before characterization, derivative generation), cache, and working files. tmp/derivatives : This is where the derivatives are eventually stored and served from. public/branding : These are the branding images related to collections.  Expected behavior The base tmp/ directory can store files that are not necessarily shared across the web and worker containers in production or staging. The base tmp/ directory (as well as public/branding) should be in the .gitignore so that they aren't stored in github. Adding an intermediary sub-directory tmp/*shared* gives us a mount point for shared storage in staging and production, without impacting development. All recommendations include updates to config/initializers/hyrax.rb:   tmp/uploads : Move this to tmp/shared/uploads and set applicable configurations.  tmp/derivatives : Move this to tmp/shared/derivatives and set applicable configuration.  public/branding : Leave as-is, add to .gitignore  Update k8s deployments to mount the shared persistent volume at tmp/shared and a volume at public/branding
