Visibility (access level) for resources
As a collection curator, I want to be able to restrict access to some works, So that I can respect donor wishes and obey laws. Done looks like an implementation of the following on the work edit forms: Access Level  Public Access (anyone who can get to CHO) PSU Access (WebAccess authenticated users) Restricted Access (user or group of users)  Default is choice on forms is Public Access. This should be in the data dictionary as locally controlled vocab so it can be set via batch process.
