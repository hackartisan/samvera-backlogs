Identify the reason an LADNN item has incorrect thumbnail
As a user, I want to know why incorrect thumbnails are being displayed: Example 1  Search results from DLCS show correct thumbnails which indicate that the data was not bad. (That is, in DLCS we don't have a parade image instead of a courtroom image) : Example 2 In Ursus: (search results)  (because thumbnail is not displayed at the item level) In DLCS:  Example 3 In Ursus:  In DLCS:  I discovered several more incorrect thumbnails while reviewing the corrupt tiffs. I did not give all of them as examples here. Not all corrupt tiffs had the wrong thumbnail. Approval Criteria:   An explanation is provided for why the wrong thumbnail is displaying in ursus for the LADNN item with this local_id and ARK  Additional tickets are written (as needed) to either improve error reporting or to address this problem
