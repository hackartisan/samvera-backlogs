Provide effective search by local identifier
As a librarian, I have a local id for an item and I would like to look at the record for that item in Californica. (Translation: Known item search by local identifier). I expect I can copy paste the local ID into search box and retrieve the item. Example, uclamss_1379_14984-06. This local id should return one item, but it returns 473. Not sure why. Acceptance criteria   A librarian can find a specific item using the search box in californica  For reference, DLCS will not return an item for this value "uclamss_1379_14984-06" but it returns only one item for this value "uclamss_1379_14984-06". Librarian is easily able to get to the item they need to look at.
