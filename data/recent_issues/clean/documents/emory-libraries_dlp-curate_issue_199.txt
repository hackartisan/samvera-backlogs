DUPLICATE Provide human-friendly metadata form field labels
Story As a Library Staff Depositor, I want metadata form field labels that accurately describe the field's purpose, so that I better understand how I am supposed to populate the field Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes In the first release of the metadata editing form, the field labels are automatically generated from the metadata property name in the model. In some cases this doesn't resemble the Field Label value in the DLP Metadata worksheet. Adding distinct human-friendly labels will increase the usability of the form.
