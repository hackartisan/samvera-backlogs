Generic work type/digital object structure for Curate
Story As a Repository Administrator/Preservation Curator, I want to provision a generic work type for Curate users, so that our repository objects have greater consistency over time and align with our bit-level preservation strategy Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes In the DLP Discovery Phase and Technical Design Phase, we identified a goal of making our repository objects much more consistent than in the past. While individual objects/works will have distinct playback/presentation needs, utilize different metadata fields, or contain different file surrogates, these differences can be accommodated by a generic work model, a comprehensive metadata super-set, and format-agnostic IIIF viewer such as the Universal Viewer. Links to Additional Information DLP AIP specification DLP File Formats specification Checklist   Work type will be expanded to support the DLP specifications above  Work type will be configured in future releases to contain a comprehensive, format/content-agnostic ingest and management form  Work type name: "curate-generic"
