Extract metadata from DAMS export files
Story As a Library Staff Depositor, I want to supply Descriptive, Administrative, Rights, or Preservation Workflows metadata from a source file that I specify during batch-loading/migration of objects, so that selected metadata can be extracted, stored and indexed as part of the preservation package Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes All work-level metadata (Descriptive, Rights, Administrative, Preservation) for images being ingested from the DAMS workflow will be contained in an export file generated by the DAMS, which will have a common column structure. This epic may also be related to Preservation Event for Metadata Extraction (TBD). Links to Additional Information DAMS to Curate work metadata mapping - All Fields tab File Mappings and Metadata Extraction Concept Related Epic: Store a copy of DAMS metadata as a supplemental preservation file Related Epic: Bulk ingest Checklist   DAMS metadata may be part of manifest file or a standalone CSV as needed  Extraction process interoperates with bulk-creation of image objects  Selected metadata fields are extracted and stored as RDF properties according to the DAMS to Curate generic work model mapping  Selected fields are interpreted as Hyrax/Curate system settings (e.g. Visibility)  Outcomes are recording using standard Event metadata, with some additional details for what type of metadata has been extracted  Preservation Event is associated with an Accession Workflow (if applicable/TBD July development work)  Given/When/Then  Given (some context) and (some other optional context) When (some action is carried out) Then (a set of observable consequences should occur)
