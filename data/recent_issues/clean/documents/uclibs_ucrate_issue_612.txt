Allow for author ordering.
Descriptive summary When I add multiple authors, I want to be able to set a custom order. I recently uploaded a document to UC Scholar and I am having issues with the authors order. I put the names into the system in order of authorship, but the output is seemingly random. This subsequently changes the author order on the citation, making the citation incorrect. I have attached the permanent link and correct author order below: Permanent Link:  Author Order: Richard Beck, Hongxing Liu, Richard Johansen, Min Xu, Catharine McGhan, George Thomas Black, Ou Ma, UC CubeCats, Carol Tolbert, John Lekki, Roger Tokars, Molly K.
