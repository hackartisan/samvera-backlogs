Order fields in the CSV template to match edit UI
STORY When I go to validate/update metadata on items I've already imported, it's a little confusing that fields aren't shown in the same order they are when I had to enter them in the CSV.  It's also a little weird that the required fields don't come in any apparent order or grouping. As a new tenejo client, I would like the CSV fields to match the order in the UI, so that once I become familiar with the order in one place, I don't have to learn a new field order in another.  Also, I like having all the required fields grouped together at the beginning like the UI, not spread all over like the CSV. ACCEPTANCE   Required fields are grouped together at the beginning of the CSV template  Fields are ordered in the same order they they show up in the Edit Form
