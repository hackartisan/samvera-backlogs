Embargo specs fail when run late in the day
Descriptive summary This is a weird one.  The specs below seem to fail when they are run after 7pm.  This happens for me locally (in Linux) and on Travis They are all related to embargo expiration and I believe they fail because they rely on UTC time, which is 4 to 5 hours ahead of Eastern time.  So if the specs run after 7pm, they see the date as already being the next day and they fail. You can test this by changing the time on your local machine before running the specs.  I'm not sure if this behavior happens on MacOS or not.  spec/services/expiration_service_spec.rb:38 spec/features/hyrax/embargo_spec.rb:79 spec/features/hyrax/embargo_spec.rb:15 spec/mailers/embargo_mailer_spec.rb[1:1:3:1:1]  I suspect the fix is to tweak the specs to see the current time as Eastern instead of UTC.  We probably don't want to mess with code since it seems to run fine on the servers.
