Try to resolve call numbers to Bib-IDs for MusicReserves
Child of #2043 See if we can find bib-ids for all call numbers in course numbers that have numbers in them (this means it's a course, and not like the Princeton University Orchestra.) If you can't resolve the call number, check to see if there are audio files attached to that recording which are attached to another recording and DOES have a valid call number. That means it's a playlist. You can search for call numbers like this:  Know that the third one is the match. An alternative to try might be  but it's case sensitive. CD -should- always be capitalized, I'd just try capitalizing everything. Acceptance Criteria:  How many call numbers in all of the Recordings table can be converted to bib-ids How many call numbers recordings which are in numbered courses can be resolved vs un-numbered courses. How many "fake" call numbers are duplicate recordings with the same audio files that we can convert to Playlists.  Include examples of failures for all three above.
