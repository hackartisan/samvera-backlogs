ETDs should have single-valued publisher fields
Descriptive summary In Scholar 3.x, ETDs have a publisher field that only allows a single value.  All other work types have multi-value publisher fields. So we need to change ETDs so that the publisher field is single valued.  This change is also needed so that ucrate will be able to see existing content in production ETD publisher fields. The commit that implemented this in scholar_uc is at uclibs/scholar_uc_legacy#1337 We basically need to create a new etd_publisher field on ETDs and stop using the existing publisher field on ETD forms.
