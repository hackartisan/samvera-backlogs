Fix deprecation warning
When we run a CSV import, we get a warning: DEPRECATION WARNING: :member_of_collection_ids has been deprecated for removal in Hyrax 3.0. use :member_of_collections_attributes instead  You can reproduce the deprecation warning by either running the specs in spec/importers/modular_importer_spec.rb, or by viewing the sidekiq log output when you run a CSV import in the UI. The place where the deprecated method is used is actually in the darlingtonia code in the HyraxRecordImporter:    See if we can get the collection membership working properly using the Hyrax 3 syntax instead of the deprecated syntax.
