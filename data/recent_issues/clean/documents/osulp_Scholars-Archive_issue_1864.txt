[on-hold]Update the characterization metadata for a fileset that gets versioned.
Descriptive summary After you version an image, none of the metadata gets updated to the newest version of that metadata. This should use the new characterization of an item that just got versioned. Im not sure exactly whats happening, but that item may not even be characterized. So on version, we may have to fire off a characterization job and then have the view use the newest characterization data of that fileset. This would keep the image up to date with the newest version for users to look at.   Verify the new versioned file is being characterized  Ensure that if it is not being characterized, to fire off a characterization job  Store the proper metadata in solr  use proper metadata on the view for the newest characterization data from solr.
