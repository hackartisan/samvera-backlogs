Main Navigation (All users)  Home Browse  Resources (faceted search for works) Collections (faceted search for collections) [#1025]   About (#811) [Person Icon/Emoji?]  Log In Bookmarks History My Works [only appears to those if logged in and user submitted a work or assigned a role on a work] My Collections [only appears to those if logged in and user submitted a work or assigned a role on a work]    Secondary Navigation (PSU staff users)  Create Agent Create Work  [work types]   Create Collection [collection types] Batch Management  Works  Create Update Delete   Agents  Create Update     Data Dictionary Wiki (Github wiki)  #788 is a future enhancement to this.
