DUPLICATE Disable self-registration for Curate accounts
Story As a Repository Administrator, I want to prevent arbitrary individuals to self-register for a Curate user account, so that only approved Library Staff with expertise and collection affiliations have access to the repository Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes We will limit access to the Curate application to approved users who are Library Staff; arbitrary web visitors should not be able to sign up for accounts as is default Hyrax behavior.
