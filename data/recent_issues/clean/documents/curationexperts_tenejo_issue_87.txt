Style the Preview screen
The preview screen for a CSV-based import is currently unstyled (see screenshot below).  We should style the page so that important things stand out more. Acceptance Criteria When I fill in the form to start a CSV import...    If there are errors with the CSV, it should be really clear to the user that the next step is that they need to fix their CSV file and try again.  (The "You need to fix your file" and "Try Again" messages both already appear on the screen, but make them stand out more as the next obvious action.)    For the errors section and the warning section of the preview page, make it clear that 'errors' and 'warnings' are separate sections.  Maybe make the section title bold or large or something to indicate the start of a new section.    If there are warnings with the CSV file (but no errors), then the page will have both a 'Cancel' link and a 'Start Import' button.  Currently the 'Cancel' link is jammed right up next to the Start button.  Do something to spread them out a little more, e.g. add a little more space, or move the 'Cancel' to the other side of the page.   This is how the page looks currently:
