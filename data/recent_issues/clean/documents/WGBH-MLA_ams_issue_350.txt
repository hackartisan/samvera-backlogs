Descriptions missing from record show page
User Story As a user, I to see all descriptions on the record page, so that I know all of the metadata that exists for that record (and don't get freaked out that some of it seems to be missing!) Additional Information I'm not sure it's happening for all  descriptions, but an example is  which definitely has a description (you can see if in the search results!), but doesn't show any description on the record page. However, SOME descriptions are appearing, specifically Series Descriptions, like here:  Done Looks Like  All descriptions appear on the record show page.
