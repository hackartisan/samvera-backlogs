Data dictionary verification at runtime or deploy time
Certain fields in the data dictionary have a system-wide impact, such as :title or :access_rights, with the latter being used in Transaction::Operations::AccessControls to leverage access to resources. If the data dictionary term were changed or removed, functionality would break. To avoid this, we ought to implement a kind of "sanity check" that verifies the data dictionary contains certain fields that are required or have these special linked abilities.  It could be a simple rake task that is run during deploy, similar to cho:repository:check, or could be part of a large suite of tasks that are used to access the repository's overall health.
