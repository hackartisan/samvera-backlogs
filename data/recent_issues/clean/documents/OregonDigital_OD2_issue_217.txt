Shorter URLs for Works and Collections
Descriptive summary Hyrax defaults have several components in Work and Collections URLs, and we'd prefer to have more like we have in OD1, with some further cleanup. Also, FileSets are new and can have similar cleanup. Current OD1 URLs:  Work:                 Collection:           Work-in-Collection:    Current/Default OD2 URLs:  Work:                 Collection:           Work-in-Collection:  (no current Work view nested within Collection) FileSet:               Proposed OD2 URLs:  Work:                 Collection:           Work-in-Collection:   Work-in-Collection:   FileSet:               (we may want to make any /sets/ URLs redirect to /collections/ since all of the labels will be that way, and it's been a confusion having both in OD1) Expected behavior URLs in Proposed section resolve and keep those forms (not redirect to longer versions).
