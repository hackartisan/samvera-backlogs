WC5 - get files from Hyrax to S3
Descriptive summary We need to figure out what it's going to take to store assets' files in S3.  This means at a minimum the main content file(s) and all derivatives thereof.  I don't believe there are other files we need to send to S3, but I'm not sure. Expected behavior  On ingest, the content stream is written to S3 Derivatives are generated and then stored in S3  These may need to be generated on disk and then copied up to S3   Downloads of the main assets check user permissions, then stream the file from S3 instead of the file system Thumbnails are served directly from S3 so searches aren't horribly slow Derivatives for viewers are read from S3  These may need to be cached locally depending on a variety of factors.  For instance, RAIS has to cache JP2 files because a single JP2 is typically serving up several tiles, and we don't want each tile to take 1-2 seconds to render.    Related Issues #524 - if we implement a fairly small lambda for derivatives, it completely changes how we go about putting those files into S3.  We'll need a decision there before we start any real work here.  (It does not affect how we convince Hyrax to read those derivatives, however) Accessibility Concerns N/A - this is entirely backend work
