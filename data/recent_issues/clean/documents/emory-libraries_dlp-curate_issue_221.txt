Adjust ansible roles to preserve host keys between rebuilds
Currently the host keys are lost whenever an ec2 is destroyed and rebuilt. We can set HostKeyChecking to False to get around this but that is not a good long term security practice. Developers have had problems connecting and deploying due to their SSH clients thinking the changed host key is due to a Man in the Middle attack.   Modify the Ansible roles or create a new one to modify the host key with a value held in Ansible Vault  Capture a host key for all websites in cor-cm  Rebuild all hosts and test to make sure MITM message not longer comes up after a rebuild
