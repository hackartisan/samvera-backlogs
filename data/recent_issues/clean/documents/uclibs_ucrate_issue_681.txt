Audit local (non-UC) user accounts (recurring task)
Moved from uclibs/scholar_uc_legacy#1948 Descriptive summary Non-Shibboleth accounts should be checked for: a) whether they are still needed b) whether we assigned a college and department (if a UC email address) The first thing should be iterated periodically. Expected behavior A non-shibboleth account with a UC email address should have a college and department assigned, so that content owned by that account will not be lost when faceting by College and Department. An non-shibboleth account with a non-UC email address, established for someone acting as a proxy for a UC faculty member, should be removed when the project is done and the proxy relationship is no longer vital. This issue should not be closed.
