Store Alma MARC XML files as part of preservation package for books/serials
Story As a Collection Manager, Preservation Curator, I want to store a static copy of a metadata record along with the digital object, so that I can provide additional domain specific metadata that may not be supported by the repository's RDF mappings Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes This epic is related to the Alma extraction process. When metadata is extracted from Alma MARC XML records, we also want to keep a copy of the XML file and store it as a binary in the preservation package along with other files.
