There are couple of capistrano plugins that already exists for this:       Figure out which plugin will work best for us  Add plugin to dlp-curate and dlp-lux test out deploying to instances in aws@emory account  Install tki client on dev's that are going to deploy  Ensure that "auditor" level of permissions can also deploy
