Cannot change Collection Visibility (reverts to Private)
I noticed all the Collections I have manually created are set to Private, and I cannot change their Visibility setting - it immediately resets back to Private. This is occurring on all collections whether they were automatically installed or not. Test location: Emory Prod To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior:  As Administrator, go to curate prod > Dashboard > Collections Click on a Collection which has Private visibility Edit the Collection and go to its Discovery tab Change the Collection's Visibility to Emory Network You see a confirmation message saying the collection is updated, but then the visibility resets immeduately to Private  Expected behavior After I change the visibility, the new visibility should be assigned.
