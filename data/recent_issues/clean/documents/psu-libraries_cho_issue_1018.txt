Exporting CSV and viewing works in a collection may include works the user does not have access to
When exporting CSV from a collection, we need to make sure it takes into account the user's ability so that they cannot get metadata from works for which they are not allowed access. Example: A collection contains 5 works, one of which is restricted, and the other 4 are public. If a public exports the metadata from the collection, the restricted should not be included in the csv. Also, when viewing a collection's works, the list may contain works the user does not have access to. The above example still applies.
