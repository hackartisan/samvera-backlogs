Isolate DLCS-specific mapping
Currently, CalifornicaMapper includes a lot of logic specific to the CSV format we are getting from DLCS. As a librarian preparing new content, I would like to prepare new content without having to use legacy DLCS field names. As a developer, I want DLCS-specific ingest code isolated so it can be easily jettisoned when migration is complete. Acceptance:   All DLCS-specific ingest logic is isolated, eg in a DLCSMapper class.  CalifornicaMapper is tailored for use on new, non-dlcs content. (What will this involve? Can we scrap CalifornicaMapper and just use vanilla Darlingtonia?)  Rake tasks can invoke one or the other ingest process.
