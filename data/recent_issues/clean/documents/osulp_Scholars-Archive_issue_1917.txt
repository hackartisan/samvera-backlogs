Expected behavior bulk_ingest Rake task should put items in stated workflow and state. Actual behavior Works are not put in a workflow on creation. 'Deposited' badge does now show. Steps to reproduce the behavior  Run bulk_ingest Rake task Check for 'Deposited' badge not showing  Related work #1877
