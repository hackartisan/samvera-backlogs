STORY As a collection owner, I'd like every collection to have a visual proxy, so that all collections don't look identical in search results.

Then if someone wants and has time, they can use the californica web UI to pick a more evocative image once more items are added to the collection. ACCEPTANCE When a collection has no representative image set, and I add a work to the collection   The thumbnail for that work is set as the thumbnail for the collection  The representative file (image, audio, document) is set as the representative for the collection  Current State
