Some works show labels for metadata fields when those fields are empty
Descriptive summary If a work's metadata field is blank, that field should not be displayed on the work's show page.  Following the Scholar 4.0 deploy, however, there are some works that display field labels followed by nothing. We need to make whatever changes are necessary to prevent labels for blank fields from being displayed. NOTE: This might be related to a field having a [] vs. "" vs. nil value.  It's possible that a field that has a blank string "" as a value might be seen as a non-blank field.  Check the solr document (work.to_solr) to see if Solr thinks that some blank fields have content. A Solr reindex on scholar.uc.edu might be needed after this is fixed. If you cannot replicate this bug locally in your environment, we can do some testing on scholar.uc.edu to narrow down the cause.
