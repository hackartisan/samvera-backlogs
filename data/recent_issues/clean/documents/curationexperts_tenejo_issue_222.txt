Refresh tenejo.com with clean content on a regular basis
STORY As a service provider, I would like to be able to show compelling scholarly and special collection content in a demo repository, so that potential clients are inspired to use our service. DETAILS Currently we have a lot of user generated content on Tenejo that should probably be cleaned up on a recurring basis (nightly, weekly, other?) that obscures samples we've placed there to help folks envision what their scholarly or special collections might look like. We have some sample content already that can either be bundled into and image or loaded via CSV.  We may ultimately want to create more content, but for now, we should use the Posters for the People, Panoramic Maps, and Sample Scholarship collections. ACCEPTANCE   There is a regular, automated process that resets the content on tenejo.com  We can easily trigger the process manually as well
