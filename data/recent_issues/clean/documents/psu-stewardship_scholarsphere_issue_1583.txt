Update Name of Publication and Curation Services in ScholarSphere
Under User Support on the Help page of ScholarSphere, the documentation refers to Publication and Curation Services. The group is now called,"Research Informatics and Publishing." We should make a sweep through the system for all references to the old name of the group and make updates.
