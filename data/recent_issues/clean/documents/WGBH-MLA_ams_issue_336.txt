Improve how errors are grouped in Batch Ingest Summary
Because: errors are grouped by error message, which is not very helpful when the error message contains unique text, like a record's ID. In such a case, you may have lots and lots of the same error, but that are summarized as different errors because their messages differ. The challenge is that the when grouping errors by a characteristic, the error class is not specific enough in some cases (i.e. StandardError or ArgumentError), while the error message is often too specific (i.e. when it contains an ID). So we can implemented rescue_from blocks in our classes that extend BatchItemProcessingJob which specifically normalize errors that are known to have IDs in their error messages, and then call super(new_exception) where new_exception is a new error with a normalized message, more suitable for grouping. NOTE: it's true, you will lose the ID when viewing the Batch Ingest Summary UI. But, our IDs closely match id_within_batch that get saved on the failed BatchItem instances, and we provide a list of the id_within_batch for any given failure in the summary. Done when: error messages with unique test that are caught in the rescue_from blocks of classes that extend BatchItemProcessingJob are re-worded to something that:  removes the uniqueness, so it can be grouped with other similar errors. does not accidentally remove too much uniqueness such that it gets grouped with errors that it shouldn't be grouped with.
