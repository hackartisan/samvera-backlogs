Translation Logic can only refer to Child Dynamic Field Groups and Dynamic Fields 
Because Dynamic Field Groups no longer have unique string keys, we need to assume that dynamic field groups and dynamic fields referred to in translation logic have to be a direct child of the parent dynamic field group. All references to dynamic field groups and dynamic fields have to be relative and we can't support absolute paths at this time (this won't break anything because we don't support it now). The translation logic of a field group profile will only have access to all the top level dynamic field groups.
