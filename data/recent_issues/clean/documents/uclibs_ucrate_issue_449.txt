Incorrect proxy delete button
When you initially create a proxy via the dashboard, it will immediately show you the recently added proxy in the Current Proxies list. However the button delete path is incorrect: <a class="remove-proxy-button btn btn-danger" data-method="delete" href="?locale=en" rel="nofollow">Delete Proxy</a> When you click the button, it gives the error: ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches [DELETE] "") in the server logs. It does remove the person from the Current Proxies list however, and after a quick reload the person will reappear. After the reload the delete button works correctly: <a class="remove-proxy-button btn btn-danger" rel="nofollow" data-method="delete" href="/users/test1@mail-dot-com/depositors/spearsbp@mail-dot-uc-dot-edu?locale=en">Delete Proxy</a>. It looks like the issue lies with the email not getting stripped of periods when you originally create the proxy.
