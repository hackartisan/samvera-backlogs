Internationalization of worktype terms
Descriptive summary In Scholar, we translate terms for worktype using I18n. Worktype term from the current language is persisted with the work, i.e. if Spanish is selected before creating a 'document' work-type, the work-type will be the Spanish "Documento" even when switching the application back to English or another available language. This departs from Hyrax defaults where work-type terms are not internationalized. see  (Spanish translation selected but work-type term is English "Generic Work". What do we want to do? Expected behavior I think the expected behavior would be Hyrax default that work-type terms are static as English. Actual behavior Work-type term is set in the selected language at time of work-creation and will not be translated after set. Steps to reproduce the behavior  Log in Switch language to non-english Create a work Switch language back to English and notice that the worktype term stays as the language at creation time.
