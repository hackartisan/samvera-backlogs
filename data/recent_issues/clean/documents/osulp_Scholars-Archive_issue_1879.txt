Data remediation for IIFET 2018 collection - items out of workflow
Descriptive summary -- searched for "Assessment of socio-economic value of the small pelagic fishery in Mafia Island, Tanzania" and there are two records, one without a file. -- not all the metadata fields listed in the spreadsheet are there, like rights statement, peer reviewed, language. -- looks like they are coming in without being assigned an admin set. Or at least for that one. Others ( ) are in an admin set but still missing the blue Deposited button --metadata not showing up on search results. The one I linked above just has resource type.
