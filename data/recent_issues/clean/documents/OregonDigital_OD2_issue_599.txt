Homepage: Add Showcase section (with row 1 of 3), remove Latest Collections and Latest Items
Descriptive summary Instead of the Latest Collections and Latest Items blocks on the homepage, we've decided to change to a Showcase section (with label) that will have one row of four fixed link blocks, and then 2 more rows of curated items (separate ticket). The first row of the Showcase section will be:  OSU items - link to search results of only OSU items UO items - link to search results of only UO items Free to Use - link to search results of only Public Domain license items Browse All Collections - link to page with list of all Collections  There will eventually be images with a label span, but for now they can be solid color blocks, using Beaver Orange: #D73F09 ; UO Green: #036936 ; other suitable colors for last 2 blocks.
