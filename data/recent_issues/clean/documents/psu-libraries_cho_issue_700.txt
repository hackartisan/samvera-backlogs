Investigate methods for reporting transaction failures
Our transactions can return failures that the user may or may not see. In some cases, the failures prevent resources from being created, and in other cases, files may appear to upload correctly, but non-critical failures may have occurred. For example, if text extraction fails, the file will be uploaded and the work created, but without the extracted text. We should capture that failure so that we may be able to re-run the extraction process at a later time. In other cases, critical failures may prevent normal operations from occurring, and we want to be alerted to that and have a record of their occurrence before users report it. We should investigate existing tools such as Honeybadger, Rollbar, and other reporting tools, as well as look at integrating with our current New Relic subscription. Child of #835
