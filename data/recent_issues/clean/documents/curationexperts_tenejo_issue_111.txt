Application should not modify my filename
ISSUE When I upload a manifest file with a name like Sample - Connell - minimal.csv the system displays it as Sample_-_Connell_-_minimal.csv. Is it really necessary for the system to replace spaces with underscores, or is this just a situation where that's easier from a technical perspective, but not strictly required? If we don't have to modify the filename in any way and have libraries that can supply the necessary escaping when required, it would be more user-friendly to deal with this in the code than to change the filename (and display the changes). ACCEPTANCE   The application does not transform spaces in filenames to underscores  The application can correctly process files with spaces in their names  ALTERNATIVE ACCETPANCE   We should disallow filenames with spaces up-font and request the user to rename the file without spaces  ATLERNATIVE ALTERNATIVE   We should let the user know we're changing their filename
