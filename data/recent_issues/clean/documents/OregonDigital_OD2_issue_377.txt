Linked Data enabled fields using QA UI
Descriptive summary Some fields, (ie. format) are configured to use the QA autocomplete UI but are currently expecting that a legitimate URL be pasted instead of search text (as is the typical QA use-case). The UI doesn't make any attempt to tell you that its expecting a URL for our application and defaults to "Search for a ****" instead. It seems worthwhile to make the help text for the QA UI state that it is expecting a full URL to a term in the cases that we have that are expecting that. See the screenshot for an example that would be more clear to state "Enter a URL for this controlled vocabulary" or something similar.
