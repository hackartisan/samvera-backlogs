Setup URI validation for Controlled Vocabularies
Descriptive summary For each controlled vocabulary, there needs to be both a front end and back end validation on uris that are used for controlled vocabulary endpoints. This means, when someone puts the wrong uri into the form, it kicks them back to the edit page or displays a JavaScript popup that tells the user that is an improper uri. Also on the back end, when creating a work, even through the console, it should not save the work if an improper uri is used in a controlled vocabulary field. This would have to work for multiple endpoints. For each controlled vocabulary, it should validate against all proper uri endpoints for that field. Expected behavior When an improper endpoint is used on the form, it rejects it and displays an error When a work is created, it rejects and doesnt save the work if an improper uri is used.
