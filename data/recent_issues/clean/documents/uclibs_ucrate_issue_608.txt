Update README and seeds.rb admin role assignment method
Update the README and seeds.rb file to use a find or create method in the assignment of an admin Expected behavior When running the seeds file, we want to create a user that is assigned the admin role.  When new developers are running through set up of a user with an admin role, we want to reduce confusion, as creation and assignment of a role that already exists fails somewhat quietly. Actual behavior If the admin role already exists, the seed file will attempt to create the role and save the user to the role.  However, ActiveRecord returns an object of type role with a nil Id rather than failing out. Steps to reproduce the behavior  Create a role called admin Create a new user Run the seeds file Attempt to log in as the admin user created with the password generated for you. Navigate to the dashboard and look for admin options.
