index creator_sim with unique labels to allow for faceting to work 
Descriptive summary Currently, creator_ssim is returning a lot of results, including usernames. This is completely unnecessary. Since we need to use creator_ssim for the facets, to get the creator facet working properly, we need to filter out the usernames out of this field and only return the creators that users ingest through the form. This issue arose from digging into issue #1732 Through my excursions through figuring out why the creator facet wasnt displaying, I found that  wasnt being parsed properly. The amount of objects we have in that field is too high (most likely because of duplicates of creators, since sometimes a creator can show up in multiple positions. Since this line isnt returning anything, it is showing up as a 500 network error and not displaying the creator facet. We can fix this one of two ways. One is we can create a new field, which has all the creators, uniqued, and non-duplicated, or we can filter out creator_ssim to not contain usernames and use that instead.
