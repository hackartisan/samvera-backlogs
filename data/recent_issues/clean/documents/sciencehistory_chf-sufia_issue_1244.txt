Accomodate provenance notes
Please create new Provenance notes field which should be located underneath Provenance.  Provenance notes field should be expandable/collapsible with the default set as hidden. Please use same indexing settings as Provenance field. Instructional form text should read as follows: For fine art materials, input provenance notes information following Provenance Style Guide document (P:\Eddleman Institute\Museum\Collections\Art Collections\Provenance\Provenance_Style_Guide.docx). Provenance notes information can either be found in Past Perfect or within provenance files in the Museum department. New plan of attack  There will be one "provenance" field.  Entering text into it according to existing museum style guide, it is multi-paragraph text with a paragraph "NOTES" separating the "main" provenance body from the "notes" This field does need to be sanitized on input the same as our "description" field   In our view, I'm imagining a line like <%= provenance_summary, provenance_notes = split_provenance(actual_provenance_data) %>  split_provenance (not necessarily the right name I dunno) will be a rails helper method, whose implementation can be something like actual_provenance_data.split("\n\nNOTES\n\n")   We will have custom view logic for displaying, where the provenance_summary is just on the page (formatted for display like "description"), while the provenance_notes will be hidden behind an expand/collapse disclosure of some kind.  Doesn't necessarily need a separate "label" on page, it can probably be in the "provenance" section, just below it. While making it full-width makes ("under" label rather than along side) might sense for such length data, to avoid messing up the page design, it would probably need to be at the top (right under description) or bottom (under "Credit line") if it were going to be full-width. Without further redesign of this page, I don't like a full-width field breaking up the "table" label/value layout in the middle of it. Both the "summary" and "notes" need to be sanitized/formatted same as "description" field    Note: Step 1 needs to be done in scihist_digicoll if not already. Subsequent steps not necessarily yet, since we don't really have a front-end display yet (but hopefully will soon).
