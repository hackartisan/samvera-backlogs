Preview selected metadata from View Work page
Story As a Library Staff Depositor or Metadata Specialist, I want to preview selected metadata fields from the View Work page for an object, so that I can quickly assess if key metadata has been populated or migrated for a work without having to edit it Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes (Requested to support DCE migration work) As we are starting to load data into Curate, we need to expand the Hyrax default set of fields that are displaying on the View Work page. During migration, we should display all fields temporarily until migration QA is complete. Long-term, some metadata should only be visible to those with Edit/Sharing permissions for the work (epic #19), which can be addressed in 0.5. Links to Additional Information Mockup of field display Metadata Implementation - Objects - see the Displays To column, Curate Form Order column, and Display Label column Checklist   Fields are displayed using the field labels identified for the create/edit form, followed by the field values (see the Curate Form Order column)  Deferred items (0.5 release) - see epic #462  View work page does not display any fields that are categorized in the Displays To column as Staff Only View work page displays all fields that have been populated for a work which are categorized as Displays To: End Users and Staff Filtered view of fields to add to View Work display
