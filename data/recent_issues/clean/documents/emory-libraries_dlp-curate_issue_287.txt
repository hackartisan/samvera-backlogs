Generate file manifests for Curate bulk ingest - DAMS images
Story As a Library Staff Depositor, I want to generate a Curate-readable structural metadata ingest file based on outputs from the DAMS digitization workflow, so that I can create complex image objects in a bulk ingest process Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes In order to bulk-ingest image objects, we need to generate a normalized source file (e.g. CSV) to map legacy files to the Curate generic work model, which permits multiple files/derivatives per FileSet, and multiple categories of FileSets. The digitization team's workflow for digitized and born digital images DAMS utilizes a file and directory naming scheme and file path information stored in metadata that can be used to help generate the file mappings needed for Langmuir and the other image collections for Phase 1 migration.

Checklist   Interoperates with/supports larger bulk ingest process to support bulk creation of Curate works  Assigns files to their appropriate preservation context using the DAMS SIP mapping linked above  Image objects may be multi-part (front/back or multiple views of a physical object)  Image objects are ordered according to their file naming convention  Labels for FileSets can be automatically generated using the part number in the filename  Image objects' file mappings associate a file with a collection  Image objects' file mappings associate a file with a work  Image objects' file mappings associate a file with a FileSet and its context (primary content/supplemental content/supplemental preservation)  Image objects' file mappings associate a file with a use within a FileSet (Preservation Master, Intermediate File, Service File etc.)  Given/When/Then  Given (some context) and (some other optional context) When (some action is carried out) Then (a set of observable consequences should occur)
