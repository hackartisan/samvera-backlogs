Assign DLP visibility options for Curate and Lux works/files
Story As a Collection Manager or Repository Administrator, I want to enable tiered visibility options for objects and their component files, so that I can provide access to end users while respecting rights and agreements related to the work Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes For v.1/MVP, we need to have the ability to make objects/files:  Public Emory network Private: Restricted to Curate users only based on their group permissions (A Curate depositor set something as "Dark" end then assign view or edit Sharing permissions so that a specific Curate user group can view/edit the material when logged in)  Additional access controls will be needed in future releases. We will also need to provide IIIF/Universal viewer configurations for files for some v.1 material (related to Migration release) Links to Additional Information Mockup for Visibility Options Approved DLP Visibility Requirements Checklist   Public  Emory network users only  Private (Restrict to specific Curate product user groups only)  Standard Hyrax Embargo option (no embargoed content for v.1 content)  Standard Hyrax Lease option (not anticipated for v.1 content)  Visibility options apply to both Works and Files  Additional options can be configured for IIIF manifests and the Universal Viewer in a future release  Given/When/Then  Given (some context) and (some other optional context) When (some action is carried out) Then (a set of observable consequences should occur)
