Extract code for UC's Central Login authentication into it's own gem
(moved from uclibs/scholar_uc_legacy#560) Descriptive summary We will likely eventually want to use the code for Shibboleth authentication in other apps.  We should see if we can extract the bulk of the logic into a separate gem that will let us use it in other rails apps that use Devise. Assumptions:  We may want to use this with non-Samvera apps Much of what is in CallbacksController#shibboleth can be moved to a gem Much of the changes we made to views in the app can be left in the app The gem would have omniauth-shibboleth as a dependency The gem would be specific to UC's authentication so it will grab the attributes that UC provides (first name, last name, department, etc.) The gem will handle properly logging out of Shibboleth when logging out of the app. Everything will be well tested.
