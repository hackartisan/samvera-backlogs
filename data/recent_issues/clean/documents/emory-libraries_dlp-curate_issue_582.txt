Thumbnails not always generating for TIF images
Describe the bug I created a test work for a digitized book with multiple page-oriented file sets. After the first 4 pages were created, I notice that additional pages aren't getting thumbnails generated reliably. Instead of the page image being displayed, a white image with random black dots appears. To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior: In Curate Test 0.4:  Go to an existing work Click on Edit > Files Add another Fileset which contains a digitized book TIF image for the Master File Upload the Fileset; wait for characterization to complete See error: the thumbnail for the fileSet does not resemble the page image  Expected behavior I should see a thumbnail representation of the TIF image.
