Importer error reporting
Every Import Should indicate the following info for each record processed:  Source record unique identifier  Filename OR record number in stream OR unique ID in record # i.e. if there’s an error reported, how do I find the thing I need to go back and fix?   Any record validation (input format) errors Any work validation (model level) errors File(s) being attached  Any file-level errors (missing files, etc.)    Should display a summary of the overall import run  Number of input records read Number of new objects created Number of existing objects  skipped (if the rule is to skip existing) OR updated (if the rule is to update existing)   Number of objects not created due to errors  Timestamps would be nice for profiling  Start and end time for each record  OR (even better) start and duration for each record # this gives us important performance info    This info also exists in curationexperts-deprecated/darlingtonia#33 I'm including it here because we may want to report errors like virus detection outside of darlingtonia and/or we may choose to implement alternate import code.
