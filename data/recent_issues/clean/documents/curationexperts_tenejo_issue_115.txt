Visibility values in the CSV should match the Edit UI
STORY As a new tenejo client, I want to be able to use the same visibility terms in batch uploads as I see in the UI, so that I don't have to learn two sets of terms for the same thing. *DETAILS: In the UI, visibility is listed as Public, DCE, and Private; in the importer, it sounds like we need to use open, registered, and restricted ACCEPTANCE   the visibility field for an import accepts the labels that show up in the UI  In addition to the institution name for restricted works, I can also use the word Authenticated (so we can write generic documentation)  visibility values are not case sensitive - i.e. public, Public, and pUBLIc are all valid and mean the same thing  if the visibility does not match an expected value the system should import the work as restricted
