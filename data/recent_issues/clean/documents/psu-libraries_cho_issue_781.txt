Visual Resource Work Type
As a cataloger for the visual resources department, I need a work type that allows me to describe materials in a manner consistent with practice in my field, So that our users can read descriptions in a way they understand and are familiar with. Visual resources may overlap with other work types (e.x. still image) and could possibly benefit from being mapped to those work types for purposes of discovery. PSU VR catalogers do not use pure VRA Core but use a local, modified form. Documentation on their schema is forthcoming. Existing data dictionary fields may be used for some properties, but it's likely additional fields will need to be added. Creator roles come from ULAN vocabulary, but many likely are shared with MARC relators. If there are no distinct ULAN roles, VR catalogers are fine with using MARC relators. Date fields will be complicated. Often contain non-date characters and other strings. Will need additional logic to determine actual date, date range, or questional date and cast the apprioriate date to SOLR for indexing, while displaying the original value to users. Might need to have a way for a human to review system-derived dates? Related: #782
