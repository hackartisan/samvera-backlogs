Wikidata vocabulary endpoint is slow
Descriptive summary Wikidata doesn't provide a native jsonld endpoint. Our implementation of QA is opinionated on jsonld. The simple solution was to pull in rdf and dump our own jsonld. The wikidata rdf and nt endpoints are significantly slower than their regular json endpoints, plus ~15 seconds to convert. Right now the whole process takes almost 1 minute. This could probably be cut down by using regular json and injecting in the Id. Expected behavior Controlled vocabularies that take wikidata URLs take a reasonable amount of time to respond Related work #378
