Title search working inconsistently
Descriptive summary Items that are certainly in SA are not consistently turning up in title searches. I'm doing cleanup on MAIS via title searches and since the latest deploy, some do not show up. This also happened to Emilie yesterday. Actual behavior The system returns "No results found for your search" but the item does show when I use the id in the URL. After I've used the id, the item turns up in title searches. Steps to reproduce the behavior Here is a sample one that isn't working:  Search for Analysis of the United States demand for Ghanian cocoa beans = no results. Use the URL and id j098zf908  Another sample: Evaluating the quality of teaching in art : a social judgment analysis tb09j9770
