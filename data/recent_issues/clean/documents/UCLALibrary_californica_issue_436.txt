Populate collection objects from CSV
Given a CSV manifest file with a label identified as the collection-level metadata   create / update the collection object with the collection-level metadata when the CSV is imported  Child of #385 Blocked by UCLALibrary/amalgamated-samvera#289 UPDATE:  We will add a new column to the CSV file called Object Type.  For works, the object type will be Work, but if the object type is Collection, then that row contains the metadata for the Collection-level record.  The importer should create or update the Collection record using that row's metadata.
