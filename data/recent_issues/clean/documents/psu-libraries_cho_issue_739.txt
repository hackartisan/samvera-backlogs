MVP Home Page
CHO needs a complete homepage with appropriate links, text, and other content to be determined after engaging with stakeholders. It is assumed that some of the content will be dynamic, depending on existing content in CHO, as well as static, and possible user-created, such as editable sections of the page, similar to what we have in Scholarsphere.  CHO needs an MVP homepage that more barebones, but still elegant. A minimalistic design that emphasizes discovery. Content does not need to be dynamically generated for MVP. Editable blocks are not needed for MVP, at most 1 block of introductory text would be needed.
