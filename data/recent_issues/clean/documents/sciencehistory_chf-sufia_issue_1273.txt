I wanted to share how we handled digitization sponsorship notes at LCP.  Here is a sample record where we added a notes field for such content:  Here is the OPAC record where you can see we utilized the 590 local note field (in MARC terms):  Here you will see how the 590 field was crosswalked into a description field which we chose to name “notes” to differentiate it from the main description:  The notes field was also utilized to indicate digitization issues like cracked negatives that couldn’t be digitized from a set, anomalies such as inscriptions in negatives, as well as grant digitization. Hope that info is helpful and I’ll look forward to discussing further at 10am! Best, Nicole
