Feature: Access Controls and Embargoes
MVP components:  Assign tiered visibility and download access to digital content (public, Emory campus, private/staff only) Restrict access to material via arbitrary calendar date selection Support for formal decommissioning and deletion of objects  In v.1, the majority of the material to be migrated will have public-facing visibility, with a small amount requiring restriction in the tiers noted above. (Reading Room/IP-range access will be needed long term, but does not apply to the collections for v.1.) Embargoes are also not anticipated, but would likely require an arbitrary expiration date as opposed to pre-set durations.
