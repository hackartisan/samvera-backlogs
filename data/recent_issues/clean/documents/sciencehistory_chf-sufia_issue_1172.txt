Share to Tumblr feature doesn't import image
Observed some wonky behavior with share to Tumblr feature starting October 30th: From Chrome, I tried to share this work (single image) to Tumblr:  When the screen opens up in Tumblr, it imports the metadata, but the image isn't showing up. Instead of the image, I get the generic menu for adding a photo via upload or the web. Following the same steps in IE, the image appears when the screen opens up in Tumblr, but is replaced by the generic menu after logging into Tumblr to complete the post. Alternately tried to use the feature both when logged into Digital Collections site and when logged out; also when logged into Tumblr and when logged out with same result. Also tried deleting cookies in Chrome with same result. Also tested share feature with multi-image record with same result.
