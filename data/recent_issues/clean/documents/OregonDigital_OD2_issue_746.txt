Create external derivative workers
Descriptive summary This ticket really belongs in a separate repo, but I'm capturing it here because if I don't, it won't be captured and we'll all forget. Derivative workers need to run in their own environment.  The code in the feature/s3 branch is out of date now (feature/s3-api implements some of the shared S3 logic and makes a few tweaks that need to be adapted), but reflects generally the state an external server needs: very minimal dependencies, workers for all our derivatives, lightweight and scalable workers, etc.  It may be the case that we don't want AWS in the mix, but even if so, we might still want external workers so we can scale locally.  (We still need to do a lot of custom derivative stuff, so derivative worker overrides are a must whether we go AWS or not) Expected behavior New project under the OregonDigital group for this service with tickets for the various bits that need to happen.  Having a new project will mean breaking up tickets is not only a lot easier, but also a lot more necessary since work could actually be done in parallel.
