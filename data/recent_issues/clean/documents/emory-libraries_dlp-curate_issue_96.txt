Provide labels/titles for individual supplemental preservation files
Story As a Preservation Curator, I want to provide a display label for a supplemental preservation file that I am depositing as part of a preservation package, so that I can distinguish what purpose it has relative to the content files and other supplemental preservation files Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes Investigate if this requires additional descriptive metadata at the file or file-set level. The filename itself is set as the default display label for the file in Hyrax, but if we edit that, the original filename should remain intact in stored metadata as a distinct property. Example: I deposit a package with 3 different supplemental preservation files. I want to give them minimal "titles" so if I am browsing them in a long list I can understand what the file contains, but not necessarily use the original raw filename as the file's display label value:  "FITS File for Master" vs. fits001.xml "MARC record" vs. marc034498551.xml "MediaInfo Metadata" vs. "mediainfo001.txt"  We do this in ETDs to some extent by allowing students to provide a "title" and other minimal descriptions for the files they deposit. Links to Additional Information Checklist Given/When/Then  Given I am a logged in user in Curate editing a work whose files display with filenames as labels When I go to the File Manager and edit the default label for the file (e.g. marc034498551.xml) Then the original filename should remain intact in the file's metadata, but a new display label is shown for the file ("Full MARC Record")
