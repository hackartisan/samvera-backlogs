[2] When oEmbed media is present, player should replace Universal Viewer box
Descriptive summary When oEmbed media is present, it should be the only viewer/player shown, and should replace the Universal Viewer box in the same location. End users should not have to care whether media is from an oEmbed endpoint or not, and should not get a substantially different experience. Expected behavior When oEmbed media is present, it should be the only viewer in the same place as Universal Viewer. oEmbed should not display as a field along with other descriptive metadata.
