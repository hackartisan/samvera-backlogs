Fix docker blazegraph setup so tests can run and dev isn't a ticking timebomb
Descriptive summary At least in my docker version, tests won't run because the test Blazegraph service is defined with a tmpfs filesystem mounted to /var/lib/jetty, which blows away (hides, to be precise) all the files created by the Blazegraph image. The dev container definition appears to be fine if you don't have an existing blazegraph-dev volume when you start the service.  If you already have that volume (say we upgrade from 2.1.5 to 2.2 or something), the entire directory will be populated with whatever you previously had there. At the moment, because we're mounting the entirety of /var/lib/jetty, the entire image is effectively ignored. We should only mount the data we absolutely have to have.  The easiest option would be changing our Blazegraph config to have a data file outside /var/lib/jetty, and then mount that location instead of the entire project dir. Expected behavior Be able to run tests; be able to use the image's application, not whatever's stored in our blazegraph-* volume.
