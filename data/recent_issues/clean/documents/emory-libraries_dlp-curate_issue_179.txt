Support bulk-migrated metadata from Alma/other sources in editing form
Story As a Metadata Specialist, I want to ensure that controlled terms from an external authority entered in a System of Record upstream from the repository can be imported and stored regardless of what authority they came from, so that if metadata being imported in bulk uses a vocabulary not configured for the edit form, the edit form still allows me or others to make changes to the object Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes Relates to #65, #76, #124 from 0.3. For some form fields, metadata that has been migrated in bulk (not originally created through the form) may contain legitimate controlled terms that are drawn from an external vocabulary that is not configured for QA in our form fields. These metadata entries be allowed in a way that still enforces or encourages users to utilize a controlled term, but should not break the form functionality. This applies to all form fields using an external vocabulary including:   Content Genre  All Subject fields  All name-related fields  All geographic/place fields  Links to Additional Information Add links here Checklist   Item 1  Item 2  Given/When/Then  Given (some context) and (some other optional context) When (some action is carried out) Then (a set of observable consequences should occur)
