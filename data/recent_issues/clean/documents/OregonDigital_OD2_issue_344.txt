Preserve Solr index (and Fedora index / other stuff?) across container refreshes
Descriptive summary When I'm having odd behaviors in dev, I tend to do a quick (okay, quick for Rails) docker-compose down && docker-compose up server.  This seems to cause my data to have really odd behaviors.  When I ingest something, I can find it with Image.all.  After a container refresh, I cannot, but I can find it via Image.find.  However, the show view won't find it.  I haven't fully investigated exactly what might be going wrong, but my suspicion is that the solr index is getting broken in some way, likely due to us not having a persistent volume somewhere (or maybe multiple somewheres). I ran ActiveFedora::Base.reindex_everything.  This found a bunch of old assets I'd previously lost.  Image.all now has these orphaned assets, but not the one I lost most recently.  No idea why. Even stranger: though the .reindex_everything operation didn't find the asset, Image.find("rb68xb84x").update_index fixes the entire problem.  I have no idea why .reindex_everything failed to find it. Expected behavior docker-compose down && docker-compose up server should not alter the data in any way.
