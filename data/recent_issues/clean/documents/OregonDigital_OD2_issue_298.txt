BrowseEverything fails unexpectedly for S3
Descriptive summary S3 bucket has an image file in it, and the UI shows and allows to pick the image, but when it is tried to be imported by a background job it fails. Testing the S3 URL directly successfully fetched the image from S3.. so I'm not sure why "Error: Expired URL" is happening. Are these urls only single use? See ticket #297 for the error that was attempting to be emailed (but email failed to send too).
