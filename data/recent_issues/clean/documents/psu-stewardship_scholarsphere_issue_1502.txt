We will get a spreadsheet that contains metadata and a link to the content. We should run through that spreadsheet and for each record create a deposit in ScholarSphere. The output of this process would be both new records created in ScholarSphere and an updated spreadsheet that includes a link to either ScholarSphere or the DOI for that record (if it points to ScholarSphere). Questions:  Do we generate a DOI for records that do not contain a DOI Do we want a link directly to ScholarSphere or the DOI if it points to ScholarSphere Should we be ingesting the data into ScholarSphere or should it be a metadata only record.
