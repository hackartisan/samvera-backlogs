Overriding core field settings in schema_fields.yml
If we try to change the settings of a core field via the schema_fields.yml file, a duplicate field is created. For example, we could choose to give description a display transformation in the collection schema: - schema: 'Collection'     fields:       acknowledgments:         order_index: 2       narrative:         order_index: 1       access_rights:         order_index: 3       description:         display_transformation: 'some_transformation'  However, this would result in two description fields in the collection schema instead of the one overriding the other.
