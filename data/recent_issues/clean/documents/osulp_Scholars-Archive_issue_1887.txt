Remove Google Analytics calls from Admin Dashboard views
Descriptive summary The Admin Dashboard has Google Analytics calls, so each pageview under there is getting tracked. I don't think it matters that /admin/workflows?locale=en was visited 33 times in the last week. Confirm /notifications route/view GA calls are removed too, since it has its own route. Expected behavior Admin Dashboard views do not need to be tracked for Google Analytics Actual behavior Admin Dashboard views are being tracked for Google Analytics Steps to reproduce the behavior  Visit page in Dashboard Look at Analytics > Realtime > Content view.
