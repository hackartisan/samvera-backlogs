"You do not have access to any collections" - unable to add a Work to a collection from View Work option
In Curate prod, I created a new work, and then tried to add it to a Collection. As an Admin user, I would expect to have access to add works to all collections.   Not sure if we should add the Repository Administrators group explicitly to the Collections being generated by script?
