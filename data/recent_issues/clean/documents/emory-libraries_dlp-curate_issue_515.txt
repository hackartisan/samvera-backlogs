Cannot remove a Work from Langmuir Collection
In curate prod (0.3.13), if I try to remove a Work from the Langmuir Collection, I can make the change in the UI and save it, but the Collection relationship is not removed and immediately reappears. The reason I'm doing so, is because I have test objects in there that I want to relocate to a test collection in case we do a data load in production. To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior:  Go to any work assigned to the Langmuir collection Click on Edit Navigate to Relationships Remove the Langmuir collection Save the Changs to the work In View Work - the Collection remains Edit the work again > the Collection remains in the Relationships tab  Expected behavior If I remove a work from a Collection, it should no longer show a relationship to that Collection.
