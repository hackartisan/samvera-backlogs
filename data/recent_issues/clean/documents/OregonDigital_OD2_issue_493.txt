Show derivatives for PDFs in the "show" page
Descriptive summary PDF derivatives can be generated without a lot of overrides, but getting them to actually display is proving troublesome, so this ticket is to track the work of getting those derivatives to show up. Some background points:  Hyrax and IIIFManifest both seem to be built with the very hard-coded assumption that any given fileset has exactly one derivative for a display format (e.g., one thumbnail and one zoomable image, but not multiples of either) Building the IIIF manifest by hand without relying on the existing support in Hyrax is going to be difficult Relying on Hyrax without some significant core hacks is going to be difficult if not impossible Overriding the "show" page in full won't even solve this because then we're still stuck coming up with a IIIF manifest Splitting a PDF into one fileset per page is extremely ineffective: a big PDF is unusably slow (one minute after the page has loaded to get the universal viewer to start displaying), updates are almost impossible (no way to associate the original PDF with its per-page filesets, so updating a PDF almost means deleting all the filesets manually), disk usage is effectively doubled, and it still requires some core hacks Hyrax's use of file_set_presenters is more widespread than just IIIF purposes, so we can't simply override this  Expected behavior This really comes down to one thing: for each JP2 derivative in a work, we want to see it in universal viewer.  That could mean a lot of things, and until we figure out what's possible / feasible, I don't want to try to elaborate much more. Related work #374
