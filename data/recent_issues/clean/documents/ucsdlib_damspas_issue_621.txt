VRR user with authorization to an object gets a 404 when trying to access
Descriptive summary As a VRR user I've been given access to view a work and the work is listed in my Authorized Works list. In the past I've been able to view the object from the same authorization but now I get a 404 when clicking on the "view" link. Expected behavior Clicking the view link from the Authorized Works list should always take the user to the object. Steps to reproduce the behavior Behavior is hard to reproduce. Thus far seems random but authorization always seems to work in the first but 24-48 hours after authorization but later the user starts getting a 404.
