Use UCLA Identifiers
Currently, californica is creating its own unique identifiers for items, which are used in URL in both californica and ursus. Our existing "ark" identifier is being ingested and preserved as the "Identifier" field, but californica and ursus do not actually treat is as an identifier or use it in URLs. Dangers of the current approach:  Potential for duplication of records w/ same ark. Confusion w/ users, proliferation of identifiers (we already have this "local identifier" thing, which I assume has its own history...) Breaking urls when we re-ingest and new identifiers are assigned.  Acceptance criteria:   On ingest, californica uses the existing "Identifier" field (the ark) as the primary identifier.  ARKs are used for all single-item page URLs in californica and ursus, and in all inter-service communication.
