[2] Enable fields based on MAP to accept URIs as linked data fields
Descriptive summary We have some base work set up that allows for the connection between OD and blazegraph. This means you can insert a URI into a form field that has been decided as linked data, and it will hit that endpoint, return the data and display the proper label linking to the proper place. Currently we have a lot of work put into place to enable this, but we have to configure the fields to be triple powered. This is done here:  If we add the fields to this list, then they will be viewed as controlled and expect URIs Expected behavior Put a URI into the controlled fields, and it displays a linkable lable to the user on the show page NOTE We need to know which fields are controlled so check the MAP Sub-tickets   #400  #378  #379  #380  #381  #382  #383  #384  #385  #386  #421  #429
