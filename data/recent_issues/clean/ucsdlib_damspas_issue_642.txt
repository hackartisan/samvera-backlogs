Create conditional copyright boilerplate, for objects with CC license
Descriptive summary Change display of "Copyright Constraint(s) on Use" boilerplate for Research Data Collections, wherever Rights holder is UC Regents and Creative Commons license is applied, to "This work is protected by U.S. Copyright Law (Title 17, U.S.C.), and made available under a Creative Commons (CC) license. Use of this work beyond that allowed by "fair use" or the CC license requires written permission of UC San Diego. Responsibility for obtaining permissions and any use and distribution of this work rests exclusively with the user and not the UC San Diego Library. Inquiries can be made to the UC San Diego Library program having custody of the work." Where Rights holder is an individual(s) and CC is applied, use the variant: "This work is protected by U.S. Copyright Law (Title 17, U.S.C.), and made available under a Creative Commons (CC) license. Use of this work beyond that allowed by "fair use" or the CC license requires written permission of the copyright holder(s). Responsibility for obtaining permissions and any use and distribution of this work rests exclusively with the user and not the UC San Diego Library. Inquiries can be made to the UC San Diego Library program having custody of the work." Rationale The current text is confusing wherever CC has been applied. The revision above was suggested by Katie Fortney, UC Copyright Officer, to clarify the text for users. Aside from references to the Creative Commons license, the new text states that permission should be requested from UC San Diego. The current text for the UC authority lists "UC Regents". "UC San Diego" is almost equally vague, but it indicates that the authority is local. Library staff responding to inquiries should be aware that the current delegated authority is the UCSD Office of Innovation and Commercialization, formerly known as Tech Transfer.   Effort is low for now unless conditional is more complicated.
