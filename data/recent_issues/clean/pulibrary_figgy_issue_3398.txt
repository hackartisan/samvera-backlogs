Contributor Role for Ephemera Projects
A user with the Contributor Role should be able to:  View/Create/Edit Ephemera Folders/Boxes for their Projects. Not be able to see private materials outside of their Project. Be unable to delete in all cases  Implementation Notes: Three options:  Users have a list of Projects they're a member of. Ephemera Projects have a list of "contributor_ids" which are UserIDs. Being part of this list gives one the "contributor" role. Add a "scope" column to the Role model, so that a user can be a contributor for a specific subset of Projects.  Prefer Option 2, but report back if it's difficult. Caveats: Implement without worrying about Solr Discovery for now, as it's likely to be difficult and may not be necessary. The majority of the Ephemera use cases are handled via the dashboard, which is solely powered by Postgres. If this turns out to be a problem, we can look more into this.
