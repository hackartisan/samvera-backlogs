rights_statement and rights_statement_controlled swapped on the form?
I'm trying to fill out the form according to the spreadsheet that Emily gave me and it looks like rights_statement and rights_statement_controlled got swapped. I'd expect that rights_statement_controlled would be the URI controlled vocabulary entry, and that rights_statement would be the free-form text, but here's what I get instead: 2.5.3 :003 > work.rights_statement_controlled  => "Emory University does not control copyright for this image.Â¬â€ This image is made available for individual viewing and reference for educational purposes only such as personal study, preparation for teaching, and research.Â¬â€ Your reproduction, distribution, public display or other re-use of any content beyond a fair use as codified in section 107 of US Copyright Law is at your own risk.Â¬â€ We are always interested in learning more about our collections.Â¬â€ If you have information regarding this photograph, please contact ."  2.5.3 :004 > work.rights_statement  => [""]
