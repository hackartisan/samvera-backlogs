Browser-based export
STORY As a librarian, Iâ€™d like the option to export a selected set of works to bags, so that I can add them to my preservation system. DETAILS Use the existing selection tools in Hyrax. ACCEPTANCE When I select one or more works in the Admin dashboard   I get an export bag button  I can click the button to initiate export  The export happens in the background  I get a Hyrax notification when the export is ready  Bags don't change after they're exported  Links to bags always return the same thing they originally did (until exports are cleaned up / deleted)
