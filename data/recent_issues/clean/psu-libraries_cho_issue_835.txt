Capture uncaught exceptions
In order to better know what errors are occurring in CHO, we should capture exceptions that are logged. The benefit is that instead of looking through the log files for errors after they happen, we can have a separate list of errors to help point us towards where the problems are. There are several possibilities for solutions. See  Rollbar is pretty common, although gems like errbit and airbrake seem to be more actively developed. DONE LOOKS LIKE:  review available gems determine best to use install gem configure so that both uncaught and caught exceptions are logged/reported
