SPIKE: How can we backup and restore californica-prod?
As a DevOps engineer, I need a quick, easy, and repeatable way to recover from data corruptions. We need to make a plan for how we'll manage this for the following parts of the repository:   On the production management environment   Solr Index  Database  Shared images  Fedora  Redis  Other system state    Other acceptance criteria:   All backups must be in sync with each other (possibly a window during which the system is in read-only mode?)  We need a place to restore to (Possibly we can use the stage environment for this? How hard will it be to spin up a new environment?)  We need written documentation for how to perform a data restore  Documented decision about how frequently backups happen  The rest of the team needs to know when backups happen so they aren't trying to ingest data at that time  ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA   We have a plan for how all of the above will be accomplished  We have tickets written for implementing the plan  Child of #274
