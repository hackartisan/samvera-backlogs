Some PDFs have blank/white thumbnails
Descriptive summary See examples below. The thumbnails generate properly in our local environments and on Curly, but not on production, scholar-qa, or scholar-dev  (Has two PDFs, part 1 & 2)  (Also has two PDFs, part 1 and 2)    May be related to issues resolved in #1735 Verified that running mogrify -flatten Programschriften_box383_7679_Part1.pdf on scholar-dev converts the PDF into just a single blank page PDF. So ImageMagick's mogrify command, not ghostscript, is the problem.  Looks like when mogrify tries to flatten all the layers of the PDF it just results in a single blank page.
