Determine and document process for archival media bag ingest error correction
Currently, when there are files the ingest script couldn't match to any particular component id, a media resource is created and they are all just stuck in there together. When this happens, collections professionals can sort out the problems and this often involves fixing up the EAD so that files are matched to the correct component id. We need to determine the next course of action for the ingest. Should we delete the media resources which ingested incorrectly and re-run the import? If so, that work flow should be tested for idempotence. Should we delete and re-ingest the entire bag at once (so everything has the same upload set)? Are there other ways of proceeding that make sense? Once this is figured out, #3016 #3017 and #3018 can be used to test approaches, since they all need fixes.
