Embargo reasons on new work: 'Ongoing Research' and 'Pending Publication' should be separate options
Descriptive summary 'Ongoing Research' and 'Pending Publication' got mixed together and are no longer separate, they're a label/value pair in the dropdown when creating a new work. The pulls from: app/views/hyrax/base/_form_visibility_component.html.erb whereas an existing edit pulls from app/views/hyrax/base/_form_permission_embargo.html.erb which has both values. Expected behavior 'Ongoing Research' and 'Pending Publication' are both separate options in the dropdown when creating a new work. Actual behavior 'Ongoing Research' not in the Embargo reason dropdown. Selecting 'Pending Publication' saves value as 'Ongoing Research'.
