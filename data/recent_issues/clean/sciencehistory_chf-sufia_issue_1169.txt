"Cite as" on Oral histories is not quite right
When we designed "Cite As", we had particular examplar/models, and we weren't doing OH yet. So eg  We show:  Cite as: “Oral History Interview with William John Bailey,” June 3, 1986. "  The OPAC also has a manually entered suggested citation, and it differs/is better:  Cite as: "William John Bailey, interviewed by James J. Bohing at the Univeristy of Maryland on 3 June 1986, (Philadelphia: Chemical Heritage Foundation, Oral History Transcript 0012.)"  It should not be hard to improve our citation display to be closer to that, if not exactly that. We have all of those data elements as machine-interprable data in the record, just need a special path to assemble them in the way we want for things marked Oral Histories (which they are as a 'genre' -- we already have genre-specific citation code). May also apply to RIS export improvements.
