Linked field as a field type
A field type that links together two object types (ex. a creator and a work) via a third field or controlled vocabulary. An example would be linking together a creator resource and a work resource via a role field. This is very similar to a RDF triple with a subject such as a Work resource, an object like an Agent resource, and a predicate for the role. Ex: work: {   creators: [     { name: "Jane Doe", role: "author" }   ] }  The linked field type would be specified as a kind of field_type in the data dictionary. The initial "done" would be a linked field parent class with a subclass suitable for defining a "creator" link in a work. The subclass would be used in the data dictionary to build the form and display pages. Child of #87
