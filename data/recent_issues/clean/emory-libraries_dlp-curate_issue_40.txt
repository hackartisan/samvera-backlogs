Group related sections of metadata fields for editing and export purposes

Notes Preservation Events and Workflows metadata will be addressed separately, and may be a distinct UI component. The acceptance criteria for form UI preferences were provided by the Preservation Metadata Repository Group. Links to Additional Information Mockup: form groupings, headings and specific field order - Option D tab Mockup: form groupings, headings, layout notes Metadata Implementation Worksheet Checklist   Metadata fields can be grouped into sections and presented visually in the Hyrax create/edit form grouped under headings, accordions, or tabs, corresponding to "Descriptive", "Rights", "Administrative"  Metadata fields are grouped under headings in the following order 1) Descriptive, 2) Rights 3) Administrative  Selected Descriptive fields (required and optional) are visible at all times, while the remainder of Descriptive fields have visibility that can be toggled on or off  Rights and Administrative fields are all visible, whether they are required or not  Metadata fields are ordered as shown in the spreadsheet mockup - Option D tab  Metadata fields can be logically grouped for export as separate metadata files in future Curate releases (e.g. descriptive.xml, rights.xml, administrative.xml)  Metadata fields can be logically grouped for export as files differently than they are presented in a form context, if necessary to meet an external standard
