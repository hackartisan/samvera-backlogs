update based_near rdf label to include country/state
it looks like the GeoNames RDF data doesn't have an easily accessible "nice" label for values (see:  so in our UI we get just the name of the city  possibilities  store the name + country code ("Easton, US") fetch the values of parent elements and their labels (expensive but probably the "correct" way) create the labels via the GeoNames JSON API and use the sws.geonames.org URI as an id (not as authoritative, i guess, but it's a lot faster)  this should probably time out around #75
