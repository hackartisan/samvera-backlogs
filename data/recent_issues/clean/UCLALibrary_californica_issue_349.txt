Revise rights metadata for all LADNN to use Creative Commons
As the AUL (and Samvera Governing Board member) responsible for authorizing all rights activities in the UCLA Library, I wonder why the Samvera version of the Los Angeles Daily News Negatives collection does not use the Creative Commons license that I approved for this collection many years ago. Please correct this oversight. Approval Criteria:   a CC BY 4.0 License is visible for every item. Replicating what is displayed now:   Blocked by UCLALibrary/amalgamated-samvera#219
