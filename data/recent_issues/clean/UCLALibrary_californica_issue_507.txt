Warn on CSV rows with multiple Item ARK values
STORY As a librarian uploading an ingest CSV, I would like to to be warned if I have provided multiple arks for the same work, so that I can decide whether to proceed with import or fix the warnings. ACCEPTANCE Given a sample CSV file that has two values in the Item ARK field   I should get a warning message that I've specified multiple ARKs  The message should indicate the row number and field (header) name for each missing required value;  If multiple values are missing for a line,   All the missing values should be reported for each line    The message should say something like "Line 3: the field 'Item ARK` should not have multiple values"  The system should only report the first 10 (or some configured number of) errors of this type (so that I don't get 5000 warnings if my file is long)  The system should give me the option to ignore the warning(s) and proceed with the ingest  MOCK-UP
