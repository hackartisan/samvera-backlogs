Untangle search functionality from show functionality in catalog controller
Descriptive summary The way it stands, when something is configured as :stored_searchable it both tries to search and add it to the show page. We need to find a neat way of being able to decide whether something wants to just be displayed, just be searched, just be advanced_searched, be displayed and advanced_searched, be displayed and be simple_searched, and every other permutation of those. This means looking at the MAP and seeing which fields want to be displayed but not searched, and all the other permutations and making sure the searching is completely aligned with the MAP. This will have to be cross checked with the MAP by a metadata person for QA.
