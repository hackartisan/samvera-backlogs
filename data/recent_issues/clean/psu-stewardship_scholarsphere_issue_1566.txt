Fedora is keeping a copy
The data is being uploaded to our external binary store, but fedora is also keeping a copy.  I found this out when I deleted the fedora binary store on staging and then uploaded a new file.  The file was put both in the external store and in the binary store. This may be a good reason to change from utilizing Fedora Remote Files and completely taking the File out of fedora sooner. It could also be patched by creating a cron job that removes the files in the binary store every so often.
