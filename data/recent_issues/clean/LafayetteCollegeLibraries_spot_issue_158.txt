handle laundry list
so i've been perusing the handle.net documentation and it looks like we've got a few things we'll need to take care of:  install a handle server locally (the current one is integrated with the dspace ldr) migrate the old handle content to the new server write a service to mint new handles  since it's our responsibility to provide the new id, we'll have to have some way of tracking what's been used   add option to individual form (+ batch ingest workflows) for minting new handle  or do it for everything?   update existing handles to point at their new urls  we'll want to schedule putting this into place during the switchover outage during the summer.  things to scope out:     we might want to eschew the gem in favor of the rest api that was introduced with handle server v9, if i'm reading the docs correctly. the gem + its dependents may help flesh out the documentation re: what's involved with minting + maintaining handles.
