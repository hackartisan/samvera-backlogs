Additional or Quality Metadata for Google Scholar (aka, The Scholar)
We need to rework the metadata per the recommendations from Google in regards to scholarly literature.   Place each article and each abstract in a separate HTML or PDF file Use Dublin Core tags (e.g., DC.title) as a last resort Only scholarly papers are appropriate for inclusion in Google Scholar; each paper needs to be listed on a separate URL; and at least the full author-written abstract must be clearly visible on the URL that you wish to be included in Google Scholar search results.  Example Work that we would want to be indexed  Datasets should be found in Google Dataset Search.
