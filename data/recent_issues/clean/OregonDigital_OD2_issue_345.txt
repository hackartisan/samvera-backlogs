Rest client for connection to triplestore. 
Descriptive summary This "Rest Client":  Displays what the needs of the object should be. It is a simple object that creates a connection to the triplestore and can receive specific requests from the repository. This acts as the bridge between the triplestore and the application. I believe we can use the triplestore object for this. This rest client sends messages to the triplestore to do these things:  Get statements for getting info from the triplestore has statements for checking to see if something is in the triplestore Inserts into the triplestore Deletes from the triplestore Does both at the same time  If we can have it do these things, then it should be able to work with the repository object.
