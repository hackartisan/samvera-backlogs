Support different types of derivatives and access copies on multi-part objects
Story As a Preservation Curator, I want to separate different types of derivatives and master files, so that archival masters, production masters, and access copies can all be stored as part of the same object but their purpose and usage can be easily determined Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes Specifics vary relative to initial migration. Digitized images will have _ARCH and _PROD versions, one with color bar and one without. They may also have a Service File (lower resolution JPG). Digitized books will have TIFF files for pages, OCR for pages, character positioning data files for pages, and may also have a PDF file for the entire book or volume's pages. They may also have an OCR file for the entire volume. Content filesets MUST include one and only one:  Preservation Master File  FileSets MAY include one and only one of each of the following:  Intermediate File (high resolution access copy) Service File (lower resolution/watermarked access copy) Thumbnail (as generated by Hyrax's ingest process) Extracted Text File (Plain text output or OCR data) Transcript File (plain text such as a transcript)  Links to Additional Information DLP CV Usage document Emory AIP and FileSet outline PCDM Use Spec Emory File Use to File Set Relationships Emory AIP specification Emory AIP components diagram Checklist   Item 1  Item 2  Given/When/Then  Given I am a Library Staff user ingesting compound objects with multiple types of derivatives or distinct access copies When I create or edit a complex object in the repository Then using the Hyrax interface/File Manager, I can navigate through an object's various file components and understand how a given file relates to the whole object package
