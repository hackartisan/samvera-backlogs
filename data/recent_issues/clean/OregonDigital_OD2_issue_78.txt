Come up with scripts for JP2 derivative generation
Descriptive summary When we have test assets, we're going to want to see them working pretty quickly.  This means having the necessary derivatives.  I know how to handle image derivatives, so that's what I'll tackle here. Expected behavior   Running a script against a static image should result in a JP2 file  Running a script against a PDF should result in a JP2 per page  The JP2s are pan-and-zoom-friendly: tiled (1024x1024), and the "right" number of resolution levels are created (this can depend on image dimensions, so we need a semi-smart script)  Related work  issue #73 (closed) kicked off this ticket This is sort of a child of issue #30
