Files duplicated when added to a resource
Paraphrasing from a slack conversation with Squirrel: When adding files to a new resource via file manager > upload files from server (I'm uploading them from pudl\rbsc_backup\rbsc_studio. I'm having an issue uploading images in Figgy. It uploads all of the images, but it also adds a bunch of the files again at the beginning, out of order. Cf   It's always the same numbers, as you can see here too:  It's always the same numbers in the files and in the same order. 00000116, 00000056, 00000093, etc. I noticed it this morning for my last 3 items, which includes C0101_c001964 as well. May be related to changes in browse everything? Squirrel also notes that they no longer see directories expand when clicking on the checkbox next to them (Squirrel sent a screenshot I can attach if needed of this issue.). Squirrel said this happens on Mac or PC.
