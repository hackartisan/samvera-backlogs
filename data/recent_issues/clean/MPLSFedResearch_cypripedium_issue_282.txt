File count in notifications is confusing
ISSUE When I export bags to tar or zip format, I get an unexpected number of files listed in my notifications because the system is counting the metadata files.  It's particularly surprising when I mix works that have file attachments and works that don't. STEPS TO REPRODUCE  Login as an administrator Go to the All Works tab on the dashboard Export 2 works with a file attached ACTUAL: Your bag containing X and 3 additional files... EXPECTED: Your bag containing X and 1 additional work... Export 2 works without a file attached ACTUAL: Your bag containing X and 1 additional files... EXPECTED: Your bag containing X and 1 additional work... Export 1 work without a file attached and 1 work with a file attached ACTUAL: Your bag containing X and 2 additional files... EXPECTED: Your bag containing X and 1 additional work...  NOTE: maybe we should be counting directories (or works) in the export instead of files.
