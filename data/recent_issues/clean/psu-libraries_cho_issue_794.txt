Rendering dates in edit forms as they're stored in Postgres
When rendering the edit form for a resource, date fields are shown using a Ruby-style date-to-string conversion, as opposed to the value that is stored in Postgres. Examples From the edit page, user enters 2019-01 and updates the resource. The display page shows datetime-2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z which is the solr value. When the user re-edits the resource, the value in the edit form is 2019-01-01 00:00:00 UTC instead of 2019-01. The value that was originally entered is in Postgres, it should just be shown to the user instead of the solr-adjusted one.
