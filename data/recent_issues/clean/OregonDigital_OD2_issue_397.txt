Metadata not indexing as facetable in Solr
Descriptive summary Non-core metadata is only being indexed as <property>_tesim which relates to Solrizer.solr_name(<property>, :stored_searchable). Solrizer.solr_name(<property>, :facetable) outputs <property>_sim and these values aren't found in the schema or documents once a work is saved. This seems to be causing facets to not appear for most metadata fields on the search page, though may not be the only factor Expected behavior Metadata that specifies to be indexed as :stored_searchable and :facetable should be indexed into Solr as <property>_tesim and <property>_sim Related work Blocks work on #271
