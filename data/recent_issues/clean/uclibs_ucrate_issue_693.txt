Travis is failing because of chromedriver issues
Descriptive summary Capybara tests on Travis are currently failing with this error:  Selenium::WebDriver::Error::SessionNotCreatedError:         session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 74           (Driver info: chromedriver=74.0.3729.6 (255758eccf3d244491b8a1317aa76e1ce10d57e9-refs/branch-heads/3729@{#29}),platform=Linux 4.4.0-101-generic x86_64)  Hyrax's Travis runs are getting a similar error. The version of Chrome that our chromedriver supports appears to be mismatched.  Travis may have changed the version of Chrome provided in their build environments.  I'm attempting a fix by running chromedriver-update to match Travis's Chrome version.
