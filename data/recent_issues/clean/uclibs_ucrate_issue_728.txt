Only show a small amount of description field on /catalog page
Descriptive summary The catalog index page (/catalog) displays the entire description/abstract field for collections and works even if the field has tons of content.    We probably only want to show about five lines of the description, but the exact amount is up for discussion.  We should probably test with varying lengths and see what appeals to us the most.  If part of the description is hidden, we should indicate that with "..." at the end of the text.  It's possible this can be achieved using mostly/all CSS tweaks with something like text-overflow: ellipsis;.  If we can do it effectively using only CSS, that would be the best route.   If the column with of the description can be widened so it isn't so narrow, we should do that as well.
