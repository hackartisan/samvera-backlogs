Create job that reruns a "fetch label" if a fetch label fails
Descriptive summary Per discussions on Thursday, when someone creates a work, and adds linked data to that work, there is a possibility that fetching the label for that url could fail. When that job fails we want to automagically fire off a new job to attempt to refetch that label. We want to continue to do this until the fetch works and the label is successfully pulled from the endpoint. After the job fails, we would like to send off a notification to that user notifying them that their data hasn't been fully saved (or better verbiage than that) so they know that their work doesn't have all the data that it would otherwise due to an endpoint being down. Once the job fetches properly, we should send off another notification telling them their work has been updated successfully. Expected behavior When a work has a uri in its form and is saved, it should go out and try to fetch the labels from the data source. If the fetch returns a failed code, it should enqueue a job to continue to fetch that label and notify the user that everything isnt updated in the work quite yet. With nice verbiage of course. When it is successful it should notify the user it was successfully updated. It should continuously run the job until it fetches successfully.   User can save a work and have it fetch a label from an endpoint  Upon failure of fetching the label it should notify the user  Upon failure of fetching the label it should enqueue a job to refetch the label  It should continuously fire off jobs until the fetch is successful  It should notify the user and update the work upon successful fetching
