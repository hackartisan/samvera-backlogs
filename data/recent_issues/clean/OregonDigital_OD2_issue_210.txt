Model metadata and predicate changes after MAP updates
Descriptive summary The Metadata Application Profile wasn't super clear if there was a predicate change for OD2. I've tried to emphasize that more, and the OD2 Column now comes first. After QA on #129, here's a list of things that need updating:   oembed doesn't need :stored_searchable, just need to store it not search tokenized fields  Remove caption_title  Biographical Information: new predicate  Description of Manifestation: new predicate  Form of Work: new predicate  Mode of Issuance: new predicate  Cultural Context: new predicate  Style or Period: new predicate  TGN: new predicate  Material: new predicate  Technique: new predicate  Place of Production: new predicate  Related work #129
