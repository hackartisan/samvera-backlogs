batch update woes
so batch updating immediately fails because Publications don't have a date_created property (we're using date_issued and date_available in its place). it turns out that the date_created property is hard-coded into the Hyrax::Forms::BatchEditForm (see: batch_edit_form.rb#6 and batch_edit_form.rb#L37). to add to the confusion, the Hyrax::BatchEditsController calls the form_class from a private method (see: batch_edits_controller.rb#L89-L91) rather than use a class attribute to define it, like a work does*. so this is a difficult problem to solve. our options appear to be:  swap out either date_issued or date_available for date_created in the Publication class through an initializer, overwrite the class attributes for BatchEditForm with our own values (this might not be possible because of loading order?) copy the code for Hyrax::Forms::BatchEditForm locally and update the fields defined  Option 3 seems like the easiest, but means we need to keep a close eye on that class in Hyrax going forward; in case changes are made that we need to sync. * actually, that's kind of a lie. Hyrax works controllers inherit Hyrax::WorksControllerBehavior which defines a work_form_service class attribute (see: works_controller_behavior.rb#L15) that uses the Hyrax::WorkFormService to essentially namespace the class to Hyrax and append a Form to the name.
