Revise Local Identifier export and import
While working on a story about where local identifier gets mapped (#435), I realized that the Californica mapper is expecting local identifier to be in a field called Alternate Identifier.local, because that's where it was in the initial data samples we used for fixture objects. However:  the Connell spreadsheet we've been loading has that field instead labeled Alt ID.local  ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA   We agree on a heading for the local identifier field  This heading does not change for future data exports  The californica metadata mapper is updated to match that heading (Update: the heading will be AltIdentifier.local per 's comment below)  New CSV exports are created that use the updated heading
