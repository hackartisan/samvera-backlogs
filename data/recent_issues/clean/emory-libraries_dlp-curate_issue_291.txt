Create Curate works and attach image files from DAMS workflow
Story As a Library Staff Depositor, I want to batch-ingest book objects generated from digitization or digital photography workflows using a supplied file mapping, so that I can create complex image objects in bulk Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes The bulk-ingest method should read from a normalized structural metadata source file to create objects mapped to the Curate generic work model (see epic # 287). This epic relates to the creation of complex objects based on mapping files to the Curate generic work model, which permits multiple files/derivatives per FileSet, and multiple categories of FileSets. Links to Additional Information Add links here File Mappings and Metadata Extraction Concept Data Sources for Phase 1 Migrations Checklist   As part of the larger bulk ingest process, objects are created in bulk from a supplied DAMS object and file mapping manifest  Files are retrieved from a designated upload directory and copied to permanent storage if needed  Image objects generated are assigned to a primary collection entity in Curate  Image objects generated are assigned to a primary Admin Set entity in Curate  Image objects generated are multi-part and may contain multiple FileSets (but are not expected to be nested works)  Files are attached and assigned to their appropriate preservation context using the DAMS SIP mapping  Files attached and assigned may also follow more specific mappings if needed; defined in separate epics  Interoperates with related metadata extraction processes (extract from/store a copy of DAMS metadata)  Creation of objects and assignment of files interoperates with standard Curate preservation events and workflows and logging  Given/When/Then  Given (some context) and (some other optional context) When (some action is carried out) Then (a set of observable consequences should occur)
