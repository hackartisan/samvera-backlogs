Add error handling to audio derivatives service
Other derivative services set error messages on the file set when they error out (and clear them when derivatives are cleared). Audio should also, for consistency. There is a lot of duplicate code in this process between derivative services. Should we consider extracting a derivative cleaner class or something? hocr derivative service also has no error message functionality. Do we want to add it there also?
