Results have changed from Google - perhaps nothing can be done?
Descriptive summary In reviewing our old usability tasks from five years ago (where some image searches began from the  Google search box), some images that once appeared in Google image results do not appear at all in 2019. A 2014 usability task was "Find a photograph of the 1926 OSU baseball team. Do you have the right to reprint the image?" Most users searched for "1926 OSU baseball" from Google, flipped to Google's Image results and then located this image in the second or third "page" of results (after passing over a bunch of Ohio State stuff):  or other similar team images. And then completed the task. For some reason, in 2019, those images do not appear at all from Google. Of the eighteen OD results that do appear for "1926 OSU baseball," most carry an "Untitled" or "1 =tFi I lpi" title in Google images and do not allow any click-through to OD. I understand OD has very little control over Google search results but thought I'd mention the change in case others had some insight. Dunno.
