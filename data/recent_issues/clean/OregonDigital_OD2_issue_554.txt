Reconsider all derivative generation options
Descriptive summary Generating derivatives has resulted in a lot of hacked-up Hyrax code with fun overrides everywhere, and we only have images and PDFs going.  If we need to do anything fancy with other derivatives, we could end up with even more crazy overriding. And then there's derivative storage: right now they go to disk, but we need to do more hacking to get them into S3. Expected behavior This ticket is to capture research / discussion around what other options exist.  The expected outcome is simply more information to help decide if we need to change course.
