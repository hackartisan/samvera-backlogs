UV errors if you select the first volume of a MVW right after it loads
Reported by Tom V.  When the Universal Viewer first loads, if I click the volume currently displayed (redundant I know, but it is somewhat instinctive for me and perhaps other users), the viewer goes to black and loads indefinitely.  I have found this to be the case in both Figgy and Blacklight  You can see the behavior here:  Right after it loads just click "1"
