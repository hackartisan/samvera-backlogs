Batch metadata field updates
List of metadata fields to be changed in DigitalHub in batch if possible: -All items with "Pediatric Neurology Briefs Publishers" in the Original Publisher field --> Add additional field to Digital Publisher with "Pediatric Neurology Briefs Publishers" and delete from Original Publisher -All items in Science in Society Collection - delete "Science in Society" from Original Publisher -All DigitalHub items - delete "Chicago, Illinois, United States" and delete "Chicago, IL, USA" from Location It would be great if this could be done in next 2 months. Thanks!
