Import Relation.isPartOf
NOTE: This is temporary scaffolding until we can do more complete collection work and refactor the importer to add items directly to Hyrax collections in Phase 2.  Add a Collection attribute for the Work class:   A Work object can have a dlcs_collection_name field  The predicate for it is https://bib.schema.org/Collection  The label for it is "DLCS Collection Name"  The field should NOT be SEARCHABLE  The field should be faceted  Given a CSV with a relation.isPartOf Relation.isPartOf column:   importing this CSV creates objects with the values in the dlcs_collection_name attribute.
