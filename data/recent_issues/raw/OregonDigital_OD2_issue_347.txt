Figure out what do with existing data in :full
Descriptive summary http://opaquenamespace.org/ns/full  is used as a predicate in OD1 to store the original filename of migrated and bulk ingested items, since those filenames don't get retained when the datastreams are saved to Fedora. It was never a full property and available in the OD1 form. I think it is useful information to keep around, sometimes when troubleshooting items there is useful information in the filename. I think it's worth adding this as an administrative property in OD2, possibly as read-only. The predicate was never made in opaquenamespace.org either, and we should look to see if an existing predicate works for this.
