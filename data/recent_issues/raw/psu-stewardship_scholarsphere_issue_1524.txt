Add filters for bad urls
You will want to a compile a list of valid URL’s for your app.  Anything other than this is simply dropped.  Here is what is used in ETDA Workflow: RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !/$  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/about  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/admin  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/assets  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/author  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/committee_members  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/cosign  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/favicon.ico  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/login  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/logout  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/robots.txt  As you can see it is more than just what you see in routes, you might have something for /binaries etc…  We can push your changes to QA and then have you run the full test suite against it to see if anything breaks.
