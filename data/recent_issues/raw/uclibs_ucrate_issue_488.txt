Files created by proxies don't give edit access to owners
Descriptive summary If I'm a proxy and create a work with some files attached on behalf of another user (the owner), that owner will have edit access to the work, but not to the files. The owner should be able to edit any file sets created by their proxies. This is probably a bug in our app where we broke it somewhere, but we should verify that Hyrax doesn't have the bug.
