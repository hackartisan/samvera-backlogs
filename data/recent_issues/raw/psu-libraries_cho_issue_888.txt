Batch Metadata Update Bugs
CSV updates seem to use the same process as CSV create. This means if there is no bag in the ingest staging directory, file set metadata is ignored. If there is a bag in ingest staging, it is extracted, validated, and ALL file set validations occur. Create and update should use separate processes. Batch update should also allow for only the valkyrie id and changed metadata to be present; excluding all rows and columns with unchanged data. If a user does include ALL metadata, any row with no changes should either be reported that way during import (no changes NOT success) or ignored, which ever is better for usability. Related: #686
