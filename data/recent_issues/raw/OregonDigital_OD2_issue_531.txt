Collections search should accept facets
Descriptive summary In order to add custom faceting to collections (#528), collections will need to be able to accept facets. Expected behavior Collections landing (search) page should correctly filter works in the collection when passed facet query params, similar to the works search page. A concrete example would be http://staging.oregondigital.org/collections/9c67wm80s?f%5Bkeyword_sim%5D%5B%5D=Culture+vulture&locale=en displaying this collection landing page: http://staging.oregondigital.org/collections/9c67wm80s?locale=en with only this work showing: http://staging.oregondigital.org/concern/images/dr26xx36k?locale=en Related work Part of #528 Accessibility Concerns This issue should not alter the search box or search display in any way. A later issue will be generated to deal with displaying and using facets.
