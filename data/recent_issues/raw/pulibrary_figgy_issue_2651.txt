Object split/merge tool
When digitizing microfilm, there is often not a clean mapping from the set of digitized images to the set of works represented.  For example, you may have multiple works on a single roll of microfilm, and a single work might start on one roll of microfilm and be finished on the next roll. The microfilm scanning equipment/software makes it much easier and faster to scan entire rolls of microfilm, instead of stopping at object boundaries. So we often wind up with a lot of images that need to be separated out into objects, and we don't have a good tool or workflow for this. An object split/merge tool in Figgy would help make this process less painful.  The workflow would be:  The studio digitized a batch of microfilm and created a single Figgy object with all of the images (or maybe one object per roll) The curator or their assistant or student would view the microfilm objects and select groups of pages to be moved into new objects Each new object would then be assigned its own source metadata identifier and go through the workflow as usual
