DOIs should be findable after embargoes expire
Descriptive summary If someone creates an embargoed work with a DOI, the DOI is given a draft status.  When the embargo expires and the work becomes public, we want the DOI to automatically become findable.  However, that change in status is not currently happening. Expected behavior Work visibility changes from embargo (private) to public The DOI status changes from draft to findable Actual behavior Work visibility changes from embargo (private) to public The DOI status remains draft Note: we run script/release_embargo.sh nightly to change work visibility when an embargo has expired.  We may need to enhance that script to also make the DOI status change.
