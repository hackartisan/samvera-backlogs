Align CircleCI environment with dev/staging/prod
Descriptive summary CircleCI is currently pulling special images for tests. This recently caused a noticeable inconsistency between dev/staging/prod and circle, in #619. It looks like Circle lets you use custom images: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/custom-images/ and allows for private repositories and even ECR: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/private-images/ We should be using as close to production images as possible up and down the stack, especially in test. Let's see if we can get Circle to use our custom images. Expected behavior Circle test and dev/staging/prod drift less. Related work #619 Pointed out the issue Accessibility Concerns N/A
