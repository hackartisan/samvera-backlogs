Update activejob gem
Descriptive summary Github is reporting a security vulnerability with the current version of the activejob gem are using. CVE-2018-16476 More information moderate severity Vulnerable versions: >= 5.1.0, < 5.1.6.1 Patched version: 5.1.6.1 A Broken Access Control vulnerability in Active Job versions >= 4.2.0 allows an attacker to craft user input which can cause Active Job to deserialize it using GlobalId and give them access to information that they should not have.  So we need to update activejob to 5.1.6.1, which means we need to update our rails gem to 5.1.6.1. However, our orcid gem (see https://github.com/uclibs/ucrate/blob/develop/Gemfile#L60) requires rails 5.1.4.  So I think we will first have to update the orcid gem and then update our Gemfile followed by a bundle update rails.
