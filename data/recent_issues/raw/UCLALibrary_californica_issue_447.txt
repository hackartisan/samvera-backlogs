Add metadata field "rights" to Californica
As a librarian, I want to make sure all the metadata from the Will Connell collection is migrated to Californica. Unlike the LADNN, the Will Connell collection does not use a Creative Commons license. Therefore a string value for the rights statement is required. At the moment, UCLA does not use rightsstatements.org so a string is required. Add metadata field "rights" to Californica with predicate "dce:rights" for all types of objects in Californica. Acceptance Criteria   A new metadata field is added to Californica to support entry of a string value for a rights statement. The predicate identified for this metadata field is dce:rights.  note: Needed for Will Connell collection to complete metadata
