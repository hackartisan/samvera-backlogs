restrict guest users to single account
came up in the samvera slack (valkyrie channel): we might not want to treat guest users individually but instead have a single one. see: https://samvera.slack.com/archives/C5F0P8K0X/p1547759697091700 # app/models/user.rb class User   # ...   def guest_user     @guest_user ||= User.where(guest: true).first || super   end end
