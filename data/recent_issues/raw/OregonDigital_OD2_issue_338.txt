Write a wrapper that uses TriplestoreAdapter and adheres to the "Repository" interface
Descriptive summary We can easily add in a repository to hyrax by getting activetriples to use a custom repository. This means that as long as our repository has the proper interface, active triples will automagically add the data to the triplestore. Our wrapper will know how to communicate with Triplestore-Adapter to take uris and graphs and commit them. This would allow us to let the app take its natural course. When persist! is called on a resource which is an ActiveTriples::Resource, it uses the currently configured repository to insert a graph into the triplestore. We may be able to allow fetch to do that as well, and on fetch, it may insert naturally into the triplestore as well. Downside is we have to write a wrapper since triplestore-adapter doesnt adhere exactly to how repository wants to work, but it has the basic code to do things to interface with the triplestore. But the upside is we really dont have to add any files from hyrax. In an initializer or something we can configure the repository and just verify its injecting data into the triplestore, then we should be good to go on this. Expected behavior When we add a uri through the form, the proper graph ends up in the triplestore.
