Cho::Metrics::Work todos
The metric class recreates a file each time it is used, maybe it should just reuse the one? https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/blob/master/app/cho/metrics/work.rb#L24 This class and and work::File both define extractible.  Should it be put in a place where both items could utilize it?
