Creating private works in feature specs makes them unauthorized
Descriptive summary If we try to make a work private when a feature spec creates it, the work ends up being unauthorized to the owner (they don't have rights to view/edit it). This only seems to happen in the tests.  Not when running the app. Expected behavior I create a private work and I should be able to view and edit that work. Actual behavior I create a private work and immediately see a work show page that says unauthorized. Steps to reproduce the behavior Edit spec/features/hyrax/create_work_spec.rb and change choose('generic_work_visibility_open') to choose('generic_work_visibility_restricted').  Run the test and as soon as the work is saved the test will see an "unauthorized" message instead of the work show page. I appears that work.edit_users ends up as [], which is why the owner can't view the work.
