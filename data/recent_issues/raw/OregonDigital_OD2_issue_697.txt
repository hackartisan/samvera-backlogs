Accessibility testing: homepage
Descriptive summary Now that the homepage has been aligned with wireframes, it needs a fuller accessibility audit. Initial effort: run automated accessibility checkers (Lighthouse, Accessibility Insights) and ticket any WCAG 2.0 AA failures. Design work is still needed, so some pieces like contrast/font size will need to be re-tested once those decisions have been implemented. Expected behavior Expect to pass with automated testing. Accessibility Concerns Attention to: tab order, keyboard trapping, skip links, image tags, other baseline accessibility requirements.
