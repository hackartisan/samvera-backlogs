Store a copy of DAMS metadata with bulk-ingest for images
Story As a Collection Manager or Preservation Curator, I want to store a static copy of a legacy metadata record along with the digital object, so that I can store additional read-only metadata that is not part of the repository's metadata profile Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes For material ingested to the repository from the DAMS workflow, additional metadata exists that does not all map to the DLP metadata profile. We want to keep a copy of the metadata as a supplemental binary file that is part of the preservation package. Relates to separate epic for storing a copy of extracted Alma record files (#218) and separate epic for bulk ingest method (#273). Metadata is generated by the DAMS for each file, and it contains manually entered metadata as well as technical metadata that it generates. CONFIRM: do we need to consolidate DAMS outputs to be one per work instead? DISCUSS: this could be achieved much more simply by creating an administrative object per collection and attaching the full collection metadata dump CSV to that, instead of trying to split it to one record per each object.
