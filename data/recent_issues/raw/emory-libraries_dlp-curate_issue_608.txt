Security assessment - remediation work: Setup recurring life cycle rules EBS volumes 
Description of the risk identified by the security team: https://emory.app.box.com/file/528500401683 (R-04) Configuration Management: EBS – Data Exposure:  Users are able to set EBS volumes as public. These volumes can be easily seen and accessed by anyone with an AWS account. This is a similar risk to public S3 buckets, except in this case there is a master list of all public EBS volumes available for anyone to browse. Security Recommendation: Configure EBS volumes to prohibit public sharing. Remaining work to do:   Setup recurring life cycle rules EBS volumes
