Turn off nightly finding aids updater
The updater introduced in https://github.com/pulibrary/figgy/pull/2347/files is currently running in cron. In general it won't affect the content currently in figgy until the data migration is run for the new archival_collection_code field introduced in #2341. So if we do want to move forward with this functionality, we should run that data migration and run an initial finding aids update: rake migrate: archival_collection_code rake figgy:refresh:finding_aids:all However, at all hands Jan 19 we discussed the potential for unintended consequences here when finding aids are reorganized. How should we change the the finding aids update approach in light of that scenario?
