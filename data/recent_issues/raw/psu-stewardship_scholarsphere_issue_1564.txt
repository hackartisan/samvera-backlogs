File Counts in Admin Stats seems off
When I check the top file formats I'm getting a number that don't think is accurate. There appears to be more PDF files listed (over 17K), then the file count when I query Solr. If I query Solr by year for files I get  2012 321 2013 1170 2014 1954 2015 1321 2016 1677 2017 1808 2018 1413 2019 106 This total is 9970. I get those results using the query below (with a date that has been updated based on year I'm querying): https://scholarsphere.psu.edu/solr/collection1/select?q=date_uploaded_dtsi%3A[2011-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+2019-12-31T23%3A59%3A59Z]&fq=has_model_ssim%3AFileSet&wt=json&indent=true  I think the count on file types is off, but not sure how/why.
