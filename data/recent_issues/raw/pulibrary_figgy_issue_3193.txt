Audit Log: Figgy should log NetIDs when making changes
We've recently noticed records without depositor populated, and seen edits where we wondered who made them. Some ideas for possible ways to address this:  Always set depositor when creating records, resorting to the first admin user if none is supplied on the command line (but when there is a logged-in user, we should always have it) Add a last modified by field and update any time a change is made Add an event with a depositor field any time a change is made
