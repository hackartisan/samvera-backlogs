Save new works with ark-based ID
STORY As a repository owner, I would like to use ark-based ids for my works and collections, so that I can easily locate items across environments and applications. ACCEPTANCE   Works and collections must have an ARK (See #456) before saving  The item's id is assigned based on the ARK - given an ark in the format ark:/[shoulder]/[blade] give the item the id blade-shoulder  The registration process also creates a node tree. Given an identifier ark:/21198/zz00288t76 it should live at /rest/prod/zz/00/28/8t/zz00288t76-21198 to avoid performance issues from an  unbalanced tree structure in nodeshape.  Ids are based on the ARK for works created via the UI  Ids are based on the ARK for collections created via the UI  child of UCLALibrary/ursus#270 requires #456 Update: Active-fedora makes our fedora node tree for us: w = Work.new(id: 'zz00288t76-21198') 2.5.1 :005 > w.uri  => #<RDF::URI:0x3f8ce0bd26ec URI:http://127.0.0.1:8984/rest/dev/zz/00/28/8t/zz00288t76-21198>
