Facetable option on collection type dashboard displaced other options
Descriptive summary addding the Facet Configurable option to the Collection Type edit menus has generated the following issues:   all of the text has been somewhat displaced so that it is no longer in line  the Apply To New Works checkbox is now under Facet Configurable, but that box is a subselection for the Sharing option and should be placed after Sharing (still indented)  text for Facet Configurable should follow the style of the rest of the options on this page - all capitals for the name of the option and normal case for the description of the option
