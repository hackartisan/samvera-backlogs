System / Selenium tests failing due to some updates to Chrome
Chrome updates causes Selenium tests to break, it looks like we can disable w3c mode to bypass it. Per some details I found in Stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56111529/cannot-call-non-w3c-standard-command-while-in-w3c-mode-seleniumwebdrivererr/56456696#56456696  As you are using ChromeDriver v75.x and Chrome v75.x and you are still seeing the same error, you need to pass the ExperimentalOption w3c as true exclusively as follows: capabilities = { "chromeOptions" => {'w3c' => true} }  Update the chrome options in the system test support: https://github.com/OregonDigital/OD2/blob/master/spec/support/system.rb#L16-L31
