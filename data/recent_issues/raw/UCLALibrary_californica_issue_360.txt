Review Connell metadata CSV for refinement and process suggestions
As the Head of DLP, I want to develop a repeatable process for loading simple image collections into Samvera. Building on the successful ingest process developed for LADNNN, I would like to develop a more general review and preparation process for all simple image collections. When we have a metadata CSV, which features of the metadata should be reviewed and standardized before ingest? Request metadata, Head of DLP, and SUG chair review the Connell CSV and document initial guidelines for "prepping a collection's metadata for ingest" Acceptance Criteria   A draft document exists that serves as a checklist for reviewing and completing metadata csv preparation for a simple image collection to be loaded into Samvera
