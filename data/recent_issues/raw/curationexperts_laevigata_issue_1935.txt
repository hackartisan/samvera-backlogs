ISSUE When I enter specific filter dates into the "Statistics By Date" report screen, I get a "We're sorry, but something went wrong." error message. STEPS TO REPRODUCE  Login to https://etd.library.emory.edu as a user with admin privileges Go to the admin Dashboard Click on Reports under the Activity menu at the left of the dashboard Enter start date 2018-01-01 and end date 2018-08-01 and click the "Load Stats" button - i.e. https://etd.library.emory.edu/admin/stats?utf8=✓&locale=en&stats_filters%5Bstart_date%5D=2018-01-01&stats_filters%5Bend_date%5D=2018-08-01&commit=Load+Stats The page should refresh with 756 results for the selected date range Enter start date 2018-01-01 and end date 2018-09-01 and click the "Load Stats" button - i.e. https://etd.library.emory.edu/admin/stats?utf8=✓&locale=en&stats_filters%5Bstart_date%5D=2018-01-01&stats_filters%5Bend_date%5D=2018-09-01&commit=Load+Stats You will get an error  DETAILS It looks like this may be a missing or corrupt data issue since it appears to happen only when ETDs/users in specific date ranges are included (on production):  GOOD: 2018-01-01 to 2018-08-19 BAD: 2018-08-20 to 2018-08-30 i.e. it looks like there might be bad data with an ETD somewhere between Aug 20-30 2018 GOOD 2018-09-01 to 2018-12-15  The related hone badger error can be seen here https://app.honeybadger.io/projects/56306/faults/52248859 NOTE:  There is an associated bug about how hyrax treats missing dates, but that doesn't seem to be the exact issue described above. see samvera/hyrax#1335 ACCEPTANCE   I can enter a date range of 2000-01-01 to 2020-01-01 and get statistics without an error  I can enter any date subset and get filtered results without errors.
