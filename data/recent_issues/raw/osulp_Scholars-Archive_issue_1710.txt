Fields not saving after editing
Descriptive summary When trying to update a field (I tried Abstract and Title) I enter the new information, Save changes, and the changes are not saved. I tried approving the dataset in case it was because of it being in the queue before the upgrade, but the behavior was the same after I approved the record. This is the dataset: https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/datasets/hm50tx752 I have talked to Sarah about it, she experienced the same problem with this record. Expected behavior Click on edit. Change content in the abstract field (from A to B). Save changes. The record reflects the changes (shows B). Actual behavior Click on edit. Change the content in the abstract field (from A to B). Save changes. The record still shows the content before the update (shows A). Steps to reproduce the behavior  Go to the record https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/datasets/hm50tx752 Click on edit. Change the content in the abstract field. Save changes.  Related work
