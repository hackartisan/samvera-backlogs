Segfault on Production, ruby 2.5.2+ needed
Descriptive summary Per all of the details here, when using Honeycomb on production there are segfaults causing the server instability. Need to update SA Production to ruby 2.5.2+;   update all references (.ruby-version, docker, deploy.rb, etc)  install the target ruby version on production server  update deploy.l.o.e application configuration to set rbenv to use the target ruby version  Since this is such a low-level change, it'll require either a manual deployment or a two-step process. I'd recommend;  update all references install target ruby version on the production server deploy SA update deploy.l.o.e application configuration to use the new ruby version deploy SA (this will deploy the same code as the previous deploy, but this time in the context of the latest ruby version)
