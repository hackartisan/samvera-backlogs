Change AdminSet predicate to ons:primarySet
Descriptive summary AdminSet predicate is set by default to dct:isPartOf, which we want to continue using for descriptive metadata. https://github.com/OregonDigital/OD2/blob/master/config/initializers/hyrax.rb#L29 Change that to use http://opaquenamespace.org/ns/primarySet  for now. We may have a better solution later, but this will get rid of the immediate conflict with the properties and the form. Expected behavior AdminSets function as expected and dct:isPartOf doesn't get populated with AdminSet resource URIs. Related work samvera/hyrax#1461
