Figure out how to work around doc.suppressed
Descriptive summary Currently there is a lot of places in hyrax where they use doc.suppressed as a way to make a decision on who should be able to view a work. This mostly happens on private works. We need to locate all the places that this is relied on and figure out how to dance around this. This may mean overriding doc.suppressed to also include checks on the current users roles and permissions to figure out if it is suppressed for them specifically. Concurrently, there are a lot of places where it short circuits this functionality by calling user.admin, and allows for a user of admin status to see even suppressed documents. This needs to adhere to our roles and permissions grid found here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Mk0CUBU3guGLDDFyuS2l6rIku5eZjnNVDMxH9HuqoM/edit#gid=0 One place where this method shows up is here. https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/blob/7fa769a3e1245e92151af9a04496a07e959b3e68/app/controllers/concerns/hyrax/works_controller_behavior.rb#L215 This if statement is inaccurate, because the document may be suppressed to some and not others, but this suppression variable is set because the work is "under review". This is a ticket for me to log my findings and synthesize my understanding of the issue regarding CC's being able to review works in their collections that are set to private. A more granular idea of private is needed and this is the key to alleviating that issue.
