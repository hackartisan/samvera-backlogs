Migrated creators 10+ out of order
Descriptive summary After ordered fields were established, it turned out that order was not maintained for non-migrated items of 10+ terms, such as Creator. (#1773) It is a problem for migrated items as well. 9 is fine https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/articles/02870w72j http://dspace-ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/36332?show=full As before, 10 creators is the magic number -- out of order https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/articles/bn999744w http://dspace-ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/42664?show=full 13 creators -- out of order https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/defaults/xg94hv61v http://dspace-ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/36591?show=full ALSO: Order was not maintained for Contributor, but there was only one item with 10+ entries so I fixed it manually.
