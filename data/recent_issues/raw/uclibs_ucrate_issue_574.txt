Some users are confused when a a new work says no files are attached
Descriptive summary When using sidekiq for jobs, files are not immediately attached when a work is created.  The user instead see a page like the one below:  We've had some users (including experienced Scholar users) who are confused by the "This Document has no files associated with it." message at the bottom of the page.  They don't realize that their files will show up if they wait a minute and then refresh the page. So we should change that message to say: "This  has no files associated with it.  (if you just created this , it may take a few minutes for the files to display.  Try refreshing the page again.)  Otherwise, click "edit" to add more files." You should be able to tweak it by adding https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/blob/master/config/locales/hyrax.en.yml#L416 to our own config/locales/hyrax.en.yml Be sure to add a spec to verify the new text.
