EAD to MARC
Develop a repeatable process for creating MARC records from PULFA EADs (note: some collections already have MARC records, e.g., https://bibdata.princeton.edu/bibliographic/3877093).  The primary objective is to make finding aids more easily discoverable in the catalog, without having to maintain ~2400 MARC records that duplicate what's in the (actively-maintained) EADs. There is a partial implementation of extracting relevant metadata from PULFA in PulMetadataServices::PulfaRecord which might be a good starting place.  But it's just as likely this should be implemented in the PULFA indexer, or in marc_liberation, or somewhere else. Some notes on how the existing MARC record referenced above lines up with the EAD: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UMyylbaDC-hECIxh5nCNbx-B3cdT5_hR7DecIkHM0aU/edit
