Not using Hydrus-flavored assembly WF
Hydrus has it's own flavor of the assembly workflow: https://github.com/sul-dlss/hydrus/blob/master/config/assemblyWF_hydrus.xml Note: This should not be confused with the hydrusAssemblyWF, which is different. The key distinctions between this workflow and the normal assembly workflow is that the content-metadata-create step is omitted, the jp2-create step is marked as skipped, and the start-assembly is marked with the "pipelined" lifecycle. Note that both are named "assemblyWF". In recent changes to the workflow service, workflows are created by name, not by passed XML. Thus, when Hydrus creates an assembly workflow, a normal assembly workflow is created, not a Hydrus-flavored assembly workflow. The question then is: Can Hydrus use the normal assembly workflow and the Hydrus flavored be removed? Or should the Hydrus flavored assembly workflow be elevated to a "first class" workflow? Corollary question: If the Hydrus flavored assembly workflow should be elevated, what should it be named since hydrusAssemblyWF is already taken?
