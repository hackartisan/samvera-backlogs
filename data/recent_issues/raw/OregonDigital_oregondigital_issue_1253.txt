Remove code in Creator CV that auto-creates temporary URIs from strings
All of the metadata fields controlled by the Creator CV have a mostly hidden 'feature' that allows name text strings typed in to be auto-converted to a fake URI of the form dummynamespace.org/creator/name that would then facet and display as expected. This was added years ago in #722 primarily to ease migration issues with uncontrolled names. Often the names used already had established URIs, and would facet separately, even if having the same label (though since this was text-based this also led to small variations in name formatting and punctuation). Though some name cleanup has been done over the years, there are almost 5000 items right now with these URIs that need to be addressed. Now preparing for migration to OD2, it's time to clean up these URIs and establish the names at opaquenamespace.org that need it. The first step is to remove this code from OD so no more names get added this way. The vocabulary definition and its inclusion in the Creator CV need to stick around until the URIs are cleaned up later.
