Improve summary page view
@IAlferink I'm experimenting with some improvements to Summary page view with all metadata details. I'm proposing to move licence icon to the other icons as located near a title. Another change I propose is that the show additional metadata buttons should be displayed conditionally e.g. they will show if any metadata in those section exist. See the following screenshot for the ideas in progress.  Question: Do you have any further suggestion ideas  that I could try to apply during this development for this page layout? You can see work progress at this pull request #269.
