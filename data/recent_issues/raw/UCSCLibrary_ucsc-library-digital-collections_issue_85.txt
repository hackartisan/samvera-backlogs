Resource type displaying as URI instead of label when manually edited/added
When manually editing and adding Resource Type to published images, the system is displaying the URI instead of the label.  For the example, when editing the metadata for the image "Group listening, Free Huey Rally, DeFremery Park, Oakland, CA, #51 from A Photographic Essay on The Black Panthers," I selected Image from the list of resource types, saved the image, and then when returning to the public display, the value that appearing in Resource Type is http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Image.  It should be the label "Image." These are the three other images I manually added the resource type Image to: Larry Gardner on bicycle with dog, Berryessa Valley, from Death of a Valley 'Cul de Sac' The valley submerged by the Berryessa Reservoir Black Panthers from Los Angeles, guarding speaker's platform; Bobby Seale, speaking at Free Huey Rally, DeFremery Park, Oakland, CA, #9 from A Photographic Essay on The Black Panthers Thanks!
