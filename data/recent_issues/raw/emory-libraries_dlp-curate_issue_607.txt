Security assessment - remediation work: Encrypt the current 4 unencrypted EBS volumes 
Description of the risk identified by the security team: https://emory.app.box.com/file/528500401683 (R-02) Configuration Management: CloudWatch – Sensitive Data in Custom Metric: An Emory user could create a custom metric that contains PHI or sensitive data. Security Recommendation: When creating custom metrics within AWS CloudWatch, user must configure service in a way that does not capture any confidential data. Remaining work to do:   We have several EBS volumes but 4 volumes remain unencrypted, we need to encrypt them.
