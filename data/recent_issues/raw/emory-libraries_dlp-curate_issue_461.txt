Date Created: investigate alternatives to storing "XXXX" string in Fedora
The string XXXX may not be fully machine readable in EDTF. Date Created requires an entry on the form, but dates can be truly unknown. We have a convention of entering in XXXX in the form UI to indicate an unknown date, but may want to consider alternatives such as a UI option that lets user check a box that says "Unknown", but not storing that value in metadata.
