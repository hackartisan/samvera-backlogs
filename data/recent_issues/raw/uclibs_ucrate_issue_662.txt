More enhancements to collection exports
Descriptive summary   There is one more place we need to re-enable the collection export link.  See where we commented it out here: 3c156ad#diff-efd97eb4d0dc5d570e1d9e45e5115f61   On the Manage Collection Exports page, let's change the "Delete" column header to "Actions".  We might add additional actions to that column at some point.   On my machine, the timestamps for collection exports show a time that is 5 hours in the future.  So the time is in UTC instead of Eastern.  It's possible it won't show that way on a Mac host, but we need to convert it because scholar.uc.edu runs on Linux where the default time is UTC.   Add a column to the spreadsheet called "type" and for every row list the class of the object (e.g. GenericWork, Document, Collection, etc.).  Might be best to make this the very first column in the spreadsheet.   If the work has a DOI minted, we should be putting that into a "doi" column in the spreadsheet.  Whatever is in work.doi should go in the spreadsheet   Since Manage Collection Exports is now under the /dashboard/ route, we should display the dashboard sidebar when users are on that page (unless it is too much of a pain to do this)   ETDs save their publisher content to a etd_publisher field.  If possible, whatever is in etd_publisher should go in the spreadsheet under "publisher".  That is, both the etd_publisher and publisher fields should show up in the spreadsheet under a single "publisher" column.
