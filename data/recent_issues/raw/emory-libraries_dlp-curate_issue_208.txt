Preservation Event: Technical Metadata Extraction for Files
Story As a Preservation Curator, I want to extract and store additional metadata supplied by Hyrax and FITS for files, so that selected characterization metadata can be indexed for search and display for end users or staff and is retained as part of preservation metadata Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes Additional technical metadata should be stored and indexed for preservation master files to support staff search and reporting needs. Hyrax (and HydraWorks) provide extraction and indexing for selected fields; DLP requirements match these and identify some additional properties. DISCUSS: do we store and index at the file-level or file-set level? Given that most of our objects have multiple files, this would get confusing at the object level. The DLP Technical Metadata requirements gathered in 2018 may be out of date relative to ongoing FITS releases but serve as an overview and background for technical metadata needed for preservation. Links to Additional Information DLP File & FileSet/Technical Metadata Samvera Technical Metadata Profile: baseline technical metadata to which we will add more HydraWorks extraction/characterization: baseline technical metadata to which we will add more Approved Preservation Events & Workflows Preservation - Metadata Properties Needed Preservation Log - XML Mockup List of all Preservation UI Mockups Checklist   Technical metadata will be extracted for files during the deposit process, and selected properties will be stored as indexed RDF for search/display/reporting purposes  Metadata will be stored at the file-level or FileSet-level  If technical characterization data is stored at the File-Set level only, it should store technical details for the Preservation Master File  If characterization data is captured for all files in a FileSet, that metadata should be stored at the File-level  Technical Metadata extraction should run as part of either Accession or Ingest workflow, depending on the best sequence for Hyrax and Fedora  In future versions, users should be able to run or request characterization on demand  In v.1, technical metadata properties have been identified for Images and Text; additional properties will be needed for audiovisual material  Given/When/Then  Given (some context) and (some other optional context) When (some action is carried out) Then (a set of observable consequences should occur)
