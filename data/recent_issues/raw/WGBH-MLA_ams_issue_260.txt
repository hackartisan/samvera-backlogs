Creators, Contributors, and Publishers mapped into AMS Contributions
Description: As an ingester, all of the credits information I have in my xml gets carried over into the AMS when I run a Zipped XML ingest. Done when:   pbcoreCreator elements in incoming XML that have creatorRole = Producing Organization get caught and mapped to Asset.producing_organization  All other pbcoreCreator, pbcoreContributor, and pbcorePublisher values get mappings in the contributor, contributorRole, affiliation, and portrayal.  On export from AMS as pbcore XML all of the data in the Assets Contributions comes out as pbcoreContributors.
