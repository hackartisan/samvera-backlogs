Turn off solr-suggest
Descriptive summary We need to turn off solr-suggest.  Having it on causes performance issues with solr indexing. See https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/wiki/Troubleshooting-Migration-from-2.0.x-to-2.1.0#solution for the procedure.  The change needs to be made to two different copies of solrconfig.xml.
