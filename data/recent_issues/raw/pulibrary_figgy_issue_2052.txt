Improve the structure for authorized link URLs
Currently, these #2039 structured these as simply URLs with auth_token as an additional querystring parameter.  For example:    Attribute Name Values     Authorized Link http://localhost:3000/catalog/c46ff572-d514-433e-b9ff-1a36063ee194?auth_token=7bd89dc079f1aa37f0b3d54dec86b6df    This should be restructured in order to be more friendly to browsers and humans.
