Add additional parent collection for UCSD Audio Visual Theses and Dissertations 
Descriptive summary The UCSD Audio Visual Theses and Dissertations currently has one parent collection, but a request was made to make it a member of two parent collections. Those parent collections are:  Music Collection Visual Arts and Architecture  I am unsure if this is possible. I asked @lsitu and after some tests, it looks like I am unable to add membership manually (via editing in <dams:hasProvenanceCollection rdf:resource="http://library.ucsd.edu/ark:/20775/bb9253289t"/> to the desired parent collection). So writing up this ticket in the hopes that we can have this collection belong to two parent collections.
