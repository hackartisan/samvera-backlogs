Date Validation Epics - Testing Revisions
Test outcomes against date use cases and EDTF entries for epics #77 and #78 and #148, related to tickets #140 and #92: Tested a variety of use cases on this sample work.  Date Created/Unknown entry Form accepted X, XX, XXX, and XXXX. What are we requiring for a completely unknown date? The acceptance criteria is to require an entry is supplied here, but either A) store an unknown date in a machine readable way or B) allow the user to indicate the date is unknown, but not actually store any value.    Form accepts dates entered with less than 4 digits (should be at least YYYY)     Data Collection Dates entered also get added to Subject - Time Periods I entered two date ranges, followed by a 3-digit entry to try prompt validation. The form accepted the entry, but then displayed a copy of the date ranges entered in Subject - Time Periods along with a blank row under each of them where I'd added the bogus 3-digit entry.    Date issued, Copyright date, Scheduled rights review, Date digitized - form accepted a date range value, but technically this is supposed to be a single date only. Very low priority to revise.   Conference Dates, Data Collection Dates - form accepted single dates here, but were supposed to be date ranges. Also a very low priority to revise.
