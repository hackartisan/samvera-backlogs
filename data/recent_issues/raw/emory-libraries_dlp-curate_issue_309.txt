Cannot create a new collection
Describe the bug When creating a new Collection of the Type Library Collection, as an Administrator with Create permissions on the Collection Type, I am receive a generic application error when trying to save a Collection once I have created it. Additionally, collections do seem to exist in fedora-test, but do not appear in Curate test. Relates to testing for epic #75 To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior:  Go to Dashboard > Collections > New Click on New > Select Library Collection as the Type Fill out required metadata Save Collection See error  Expected behavior I should be able to create and save a new collection once required metadata is supplied. Note that previously configured Collection Types were lost and recreated during our AWS transition. I was previously able to create new collections prior to this.
