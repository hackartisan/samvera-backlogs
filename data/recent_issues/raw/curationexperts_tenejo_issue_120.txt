Document acceptable values for controlled fields
STORY As a user, I'd like to know which fields use controlled vocabularies and what values I can use in each, so that I don't waste time filling out my manifest incorrectly. DETAILS: In the Editor UI, the following fields are controlled by an external vocabulary.  For each field, I need to know whether to fill in a string, a URI, or ???.  For locally defined lists, I need to know what the valid values are.  Rights statement License Location Resource type Visibility  For the file related items, I'm assuming that the valid list is any of the filenames from the files field, but want to confirm this assumption for:  Representative Media Thumbnail Rendering  ACCEPTANCE   Documentation exists that tells me which fields use controlled vocabularies  The documentation provides a list of valid values (e.g. for Resource type) or indicates where I can find valid values (e.g. for Location)  See Also  #62
