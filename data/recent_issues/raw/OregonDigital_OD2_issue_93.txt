Create code to generate signed URLs for S3 assets we want to keep private
Descriptive summary OD1 reads all assets from disk and then writes them out to the client (browser).  This is necessary to check access restrictions.  But it's slow and can block other requests coming in, which is especially bad for huge file downloads. If we store our content in S3, we can have it be private, but generate short-lived "signed URLs".  These can then be used in a redirect request from our app after all the access checks have been made.  User requests an asset's full size / original content App verifies user can get asset  If not, this is easy: 403 response   App generates a signed URL that lasts a short while.  Ten minutes? App redirects to the signed URL  Expected behavior   Users can get at protected and public assets "content" datastream  Signed URLs live long enough for users to get the data  Signed URLs properly expire (e.g., we don't have a bug that generates 10 week URLs)
