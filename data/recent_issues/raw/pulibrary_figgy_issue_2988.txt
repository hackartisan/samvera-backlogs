Images do not display in UV on figgy-staging
There’s a problem with figgy-staging that I don’t understand. I thought it was just the coins I imported last night, but it appears in other resources as well. The UV fails to load image tiles, throwing this error: Tile a.Tile failed to load: https://figgy-staging/cantaloupe/iiif/2/77%2F86%2F08%2F77860841d01b49478b234a340b410497%2Fintermediate_file.jp2/full/29,/0/default.jpg - error: Image load aborted https://figgy-staging.princeton.edu/catalog/5c17218c-c321-4220-b5a9-a6bfa65468dc No clue why the domain and TLD are being dropped. The manifest looks fine to me. https://figgy-staging.princeton.edu/concern/scanned_resources/5c17218c-c321-4220-b5a9-a6bfa65468dc/manifest No idea how long this has been happening. Related to the shift to NGINX? A Cantaloupe issue?
