Expand abilities to include actions from spreadsheet and implement throughout OD2
Descriptive summary Spreadsheet with roles and actions found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Mk0CUBU3guGLDDFyuS2l6rIku5eZjnNVDMxH9HuqoM/edit#gid=0 The left most column of the spreadsheet lists the actions that can be taken in the system. These actions need to be translated into abilities in the Ability.rb file. We may want to organize them more by creating 'themed' behaviors surrounding different pieces like "works" "collections" etc. These abilities will look at IP ranges and roles associated with a specific user and make decisions based on whether or not that user within the specific ip range and role can do a specific action. There will be a lot of work finding all the places these abilities need to be set in and verified.   Translate spreadsheet into Abilities "actions"  Verify that "actions" are returning the right result on a per role basis  Expand OD2 to utilize new "actions" to allow users to do certain things in the system Whitelist/Blacklist IP ranges Expand "actions" to utilize IP ranges to further enhance the permissions functionality  Expected behavior The expected behavior of this feature is "when a user has a specific Role/IP in the system and chooses to do an action found in the spreadsheet, the user should be allowed/disallowed to do that action based on their role/IP" Current Behavior A user can either be an admin or non admin. NOTE Eventually we may want to expand this to a "Per collection" grouping as well, which we may want to keep in mind while expanding this feature set. Syntax: if can? :show, @presenter will be a common one we use. Documentation https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan Cancancan documentation
