Can't edit works imported with a location
ISSUE When I import records using the importer, they show up as expected, but I get a "We're sorry, but something went wrong error when I try to edit them." STEPS TO REPRODUCE  Download the sample file in this gist loc-images.csv to use for the test Login as a user with admin privileges Create a new empty collection for the test Start a new CSV import Select the file loc-images.csv (from step 1) Select the collection you created in step 3 Begin the import Wait for the import to finish View the collection Edit one of the three items with a location specified ("In March read the books you've always meant to read", "See America Welcome to Montana / / R. Halls","Prints for the people A national exhibition...") Click on Edit from that image's single item show page  EXPECTED RESULTS I should be able to edit the metadata for the imported image. ACTUAL RESULTS I get the "We're sorry, but something went wrong" page. see https://app.honeybadger.io/projects/59580/faults/45325894 NOTE: I've tried providing both string "Montana" and URI http://www.geonames.org/5667009/montana.html values for the location field.
