Preservation Event - Generate multiple checksum types
Story As a Preservation Curator, I want to generate multiple checksums using specified algorithms for assets ingested to the repository, so that we align with approved Digital Preservation requirements and industry best practices to monitor changes to file integrity Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes From the Digital Preservation Group's requirements, "The repository will calculate SHA1, MD5Sum, and SHA256 checksums for all of the component files in a work. The repository can calculate the initial hashes for an object when it first takes the files in for accessioning (as the object is being prepared before it is saved to Fedora). " Links to Additional Information Approved Preservation Events & Workflows Preservation - Metadata Properties Needed Preservation Log - XML Mockup File & FileSet/Technical Metadata List of all Preservation UI Mockups TO CONFIRM:  how many checksums can be generated/stored for non-Master files? Should we set a minimum for the other file uses? Checklist   Generate MD5Sum  Generate SHA1  Generate SHA256  Store checksum values in File-level metadata, and also part of the Event detail  Related to separate epic: As checksums are generated during Ingest, A Message Digest Calculation event can be stored as part of standard Events metadata. Given/When/Then  Given (some context) and (some other optional context) When (some action is carried out) Then (a set of observable consequences should occur)
