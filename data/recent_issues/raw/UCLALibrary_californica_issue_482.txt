STORY As a collection owner, I'd like an option in the collection view (i.e. dashboard/collections/*[collection_id]* to set the collection thumbnail from a specific work, so that I have a quick and easy way to set the collection-level thumbnail. ACCEPTANCE When I'm on the dashboard page for a specific collection dashboard/collections/*[collection_id]*   There is a button I can click to set the thumbnail  [BONUS] the button also indicates which work has been selected as the thumbnail  MOCKUP
