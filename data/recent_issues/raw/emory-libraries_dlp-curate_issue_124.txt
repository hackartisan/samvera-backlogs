Auto-complete metadata for selected uncontrolled text fields
Story As a Metadata Specialist or Staff Depositor, I want to implement auto-complete/type-ahead for selected fields, so that depositors using a form can enter data more quickly and consistently when using a form Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes Some uncontrolled text fields such as keywords would benefit from having an auto-complete feature to help similar entries become more consistent. Priority: Some fields which should use an authority, but entries may not always exist, like Creators (could be Emory people or formally defined authority entries):     Institution (D1)    Subject – Time Periods (D33)    Role – Creator (D45)    Role – Contributor (D46)    Role Sponsor (D50)    Role - Grant/Funding Agency (D53)    Rights Holder (D58)  Enhancement: other fields will not draw from a formal authority, but may benefit from auto-complete if they have already been populated in the repository by other Emory depositors:  Keywords (D29) Conference/Meeting Name (D34) Parent Work Title (D38)  Links to Additional Information Metadata implementation worksheet Auto-suggest field recommendations CV Usage Notes Checklist   Priority - enable users to enter custom terms for selected QA fields (see above)  Given/When/Then  Given I am a Curate user editing metadata using the generic work form When I am entering a person, organization or event name that doesn't exist in a major authority Then I can enter my own term in the field (and ideally other Curate users can use it too)
