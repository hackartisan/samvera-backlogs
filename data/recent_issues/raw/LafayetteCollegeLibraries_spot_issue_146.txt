catalog_controller not loading search fields
so way back in may '18 (d0d681d) i removed the show fields from the catalog_controller config because hyrax doesn't use them for the work show views. it does, however, use those fields when populating the 'all_fields' search field. since they've been removed, the search is only using file_format_tesim and all_text_timv (see output in #145). since we're starting to define search fields within solrconfig.xml, we might do best to define those fields in there, or use the default and leave the 'all_fields' config without a block: # ... config.add_search_field 'all_fields', label: 'All Fields' # ...
