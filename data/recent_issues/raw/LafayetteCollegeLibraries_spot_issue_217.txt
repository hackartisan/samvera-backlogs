rdf labels not fetching correctly
not entirely sure what's happening, but it looks like there's an issue with our rdf labels for location not being fetched properly.  ☝️ this is from a shakespeare bulletin item. the rdf value is: <http://ldr.dev.lafayette.edu/concern/publications/8p58pc92q>   <http://purl.org/dc/terms/spatial> <http://sws.geonames.org/5234372/>; unlike the label, http://sws.geonames.org/5234372/ is actually burlington vermont. it looks like the cache is being used regardless of the value
