Re-importing existing zip files
When re-importing a zip file that has already been extracted, if there were previous errors, the extracted bag should be removed before the zip is extracted again. If the extracted bag is already valid, then it should not be extracted. Workflow:  User imports an existing zip file with failures:   application reads the status of the extracted bag application determines it is invalid from a previous import attempt the extracted bag is automatically deleted and the bag re-extracted from the provided zip file validation proceeds as normal   User needs to reimport a valid zip   application determines that the new zip is different than the extracted bag and removes it before proceeding with the rest of the validation  Blocked by #598
