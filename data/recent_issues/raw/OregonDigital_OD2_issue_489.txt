Tests can fail when DEPLOYED_VERSION is set in the environment
Descriptive summary Tests validate that the footer has the app's const VERSION printed.  In my environment (and as far as I can tell, in any docker-based setup), however, DEPLOY_VERSION is set to "development", and the actual footer code prefers DEPLOY_VERSION to VERSION. Expected behavior Minimum: tests should verify the actual behavior, not what happens only sometimes.  I'd argue, though, that we shouldn't let DEPLOY_VERSION override the reported application version.  It could get very confusing if that environment variable got some weird value and we weren't able to see at a glance what's actually been deployed.
