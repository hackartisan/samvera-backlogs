Permissions to Add/Remove Projects from Digital Objects
Right now, any user can add/remove projects for a digital objects via an update action. We need to decide:  Who should be able to add/remove projects for a digital object? What project's should be user be able to add/remove from?  Eric's suggestion is the following: "I think it actually does make sense for a person to be able to add an existing object to another project -- even if the person doesn't have any permissions in that other project" "but that said, we still need the protection that we just talked about when it comes to project removal" One complicating factor to Eric's suggestion is that the /projects endpoint returns all the projects a User has read access to.
