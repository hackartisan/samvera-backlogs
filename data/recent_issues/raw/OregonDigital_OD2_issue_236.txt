Present top collections on search results page.
Descriptive summary As a researcher, search results could be more helpful if, alongside the item results, the collections that were strong in the search terms were also shown. Expected behavior On the search results for end users, collections could be pulled forward in the hierarchy for presentation alongside (but separate from) individual item results. This could be accomplished in two (more?) directions explained here with a search of OD for the term "WWII":   sheer number of matching results -- the top collections for WWII are "Art and Architecture Images Collection" and "OSU Special Collections & Archives Research Center" -- kinda generic but I know there are a lot of WWII things in there   refined to benefit users (while remaining as unbiased as possible, of course) -- top collections might be "OSU's WWII Era Japanese American Students" (it's in the title) and "UO Veterans" -- this might be attached to metadata for a collection (should that come into existence?) -- or might be attached to sheer numbers but as a percentage (thanks, @wickr) For example, 80% of a collection's items carries WWII versus 10% of a much larger collection.... or? See related work below.   Related work What are the requirements we'd like for matching collections? Evaluate what SOLR is doing exactly in order to refine it. #238 Make sure test data in use, etc. allows for this kind of spin on testing (thanks, @revgum) In a broad sense if collections carrying some metadata is the solution, possibly #43
