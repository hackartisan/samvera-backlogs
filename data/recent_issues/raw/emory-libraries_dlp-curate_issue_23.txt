Support primary vs supplemental designations for content files and supplemental preservation files 
Story As a Preservation Curator, I want to accommodate Emory AIP categories (Content, Metadata, Supplemental Preservation Files) but also support derivative/master delineations within content files, so that we can accommodate primary/supplemental designations for content vs supplemental preservation files as well as delineating types of file usage Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes Emory AIP specification delineates the following within a preservation object package: Files are broken down into one of three top-level categories:  Primary Content (displays to end users) Supplemental Content (displays to end users) Supplemental Preservation Files (display to Staff/Curate users only)  Metadata  Actionable/indexed metadata such as Descriptive, Rights, Admin  Content files' binaries can be further broken out into derivative types (see #22):  Preservation Master File Intermediate File (high resolution access copy) Service File (lower resolution/watermarked access copy) Thumbnail (as generated by ingest process) Extracted Text File Character Positioning Data Transcript File  Supplemental content files and supplemental preservation files are not anticipated to have multiple kinds of derivatives, only primary content files.
