Update ingest process to add works to a collection
ACCEPTANCE When my import CSV has a column with a collection-ark in it   The corresponding work is added to the collection   If a collection with the collection-ark doesn't exist, a new collection with that ark is created  Automatically created collections have default metadata so they can be opened in the edit UI without errors.
