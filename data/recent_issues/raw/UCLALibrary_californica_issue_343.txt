revise the capistrano deploy for californica to fail if an ingest is in process
Based on observations during an ingest on the californica-test server, where an ongoing ingest process failed due to a Jenkins deploy process based on the CD workflow (i.e. a pull request was merged to californica's master branch on github), the capistrano deploy task needs to fail if an ongoing ingest task is detected. This easily-recovered-from error (a failed deploy) is preferable to the more difficult to recover ingest process failure. ACCEPTANCE   the capistrano deploy fails if an ingest task is detected  the capistrano deploy works correctly under normal circumstances
