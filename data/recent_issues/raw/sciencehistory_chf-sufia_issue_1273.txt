Can easily change label [including notes below in case we need to crosswalk this field into MARC 590 or DC description field, per Library Company example] 590 notes field: https://www.oclc.org/bibformats/en/5xx/590.html From: Joniec, Nicole Sent: Wednesday, July 03, 2019 9:00 AM To: Kativa, Hillary HKativa@ScienceHistory.org Subject: Notes field Good morning, Hillary. I wanted to share how we handled digitization sponsorship notes at LCP.  Here is a sample record where we added a notes field for such content: https://digital.librarycompany.org/islandora/object/Islandora%3A5448?solr_nav%5Bid%5D=b54fbbf11d1096627fc9&solr_nav%5Bpage%5D=0&solr_nav%5Boffset%5D=0 Here is the OPAC record where you can see we utilized the 590 local note field (in MARC terms): http://pacscl.exlibrisgroup.com:48992/F/BRD381BBN9MJ649RDLNNGP66KDVDG8R5ER8NR242XTT7ID4Q82-20304?func=direct&doc_number=000307307&current_base=&format=001 Here you will see how the 590 field was crosswalked into a description field which we chose to name “notes” to differentiate it from the main description: https://www.loc.gov/marc/marc2dc.html The notes field was also utilized to indicate digitization issues like cracked negatives that couldn’t be digitized from a set, anomalies such as inscriptions in negatives, as well as grant digitization. Hope that info is helpful and I’ll look forward to discussing further at 10am! Best, Nicole
