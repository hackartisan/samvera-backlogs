SDHC Oral Histories - replace HTML service file with PDF
Descriptive summary   Per the request of the San Diego History Center staff, we need to swap the HTML service file with a PDF version in the San Diego History Center Oral Histories collection. The HTML file should be saved as a document-source (or text?) that can be downloaded by curators.   As a complex object (e.g. https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/object/bb2629146f), the PDF is the transcript component. Note that not all objects are complex in this collection set.   The collection should show thumbnails derived from the PDFs.   52 objects in the collection   Location of Files  \libstorage.ucsd.edu\digital-staging\San Diego History Center Oral Histories
