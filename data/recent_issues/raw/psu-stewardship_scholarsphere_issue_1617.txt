remove empty string from resource_type
The blank resource type (#1396) is still lingering in  some objects' resource type field. For example: {         "has_model_ssim":["GenericWork"],         "id":"5712m6699",         "resource_type_tesim":["", "Other"]}]   } This csv (which I've renamed to .txt to agree with Github's restrictions on files that can be attached to issues)  includes a list of objects that need to be fixed, along with the corrected value for the resource type. Columns are: id, has_model_ssim, OLD_resource_type_tesim,  NEW_resource_type_tesim. Hopefully this file can be used for a batch update.
