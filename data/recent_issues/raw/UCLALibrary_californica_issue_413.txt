Identify the reason an LADNN item has incorrect thumbnail
As a user, I want to know why incorrect thumbnails are being displayed: Example 1 http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/Search.do?selectedProjects=all&viewType=1&keyWord=Boy+Scout+Frank+Portune+testifies+for+the+court+regarding+the+discovery+of+the+bodies+of+murdered+children+Jeanette+Stevens+and+Melba+and+Madeline+Everett.+August+12%2C+1937 Search results from DLCS show correct thumbnails which indicate that the data was not bad. (That is, in DLCS we don't have a parade image instead of a courtroom image) :http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/Search.do?selectedProjects=all&viewType=1&keyWord=Boy+Scout+Frank+Portune+testifies+for+the+court+regarding+the+discovery+of+the+bodies+of+murdered+children+Jeanette+Stevens+and+Melba+and+Madeline+Everett.+August+12%2C+1937 Example 2 In Ursus: (search results) https://ursus.library.ucla.edu/catalog?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_field=all_fields&q=albert+portune (because thumbnail is not displayed at the item level) In DLCS: http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/viewItem.do?ark=21198/zz0027xhzt Example 3 In Ursus: https://ursus.library.ucla.edu/catalog?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_field=all_fields&q=Cyclists+compete+in+a+six-day+bicycle+race+at+Pan-Pacific+Auditorium%2C+Los+Angeles%2C+1937 In DLCS: http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/viewItem.do?ark=21198/zz00288rfb I discovered several more incorrect thumbnails while reviewing the corrupt tiffs. I did not give all of them as examples here. Not all corrupt tiffs had the wrong thumbnail. Approval Criteria:   An explanation is provided for why the wrong thumbnail is displaying in ursus for the LADNN item with this local_id and ARK  Additional tickets are written (as needed) to either improve error reporting or to address this problem
