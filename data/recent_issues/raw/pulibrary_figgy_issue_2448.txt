New Record Templates/Dashboard
Currently, studio staff have to know what object type to create objects in, and what collections/etc. to set for scanned resources.  I talked with @kelea99 about making the slip that accompanies items more detailed to include this information. But I think we could create new record templates, where you would select all of those settings to configure object type, collections, visibility, etc.  And then we could have a dashboard that would list the current projects, with a button you could click for each one that would create the correct object type with those things pre-populated.
