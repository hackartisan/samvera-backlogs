Add an 'ark' property to the UCLA data model
ACCEPTANCE   I can store and read a single valued ark property  The ark appears on work show pages  The ark appears on collection show pages  The ark is editable on new work pages as a required field  The ark is editable on new collection pages as a required field  The ark is NOT editable on work edit pages  The ark is NOT editable on collection edit pages  ark uses the predicate DC11.identifier  Searches for a specific work's ark should return only one work   The ark is required in the CSV import and fails if a record doesn't contain an ark value - separated into #527 All existing production data is re-imported (metadata update only) to reflect new ark property and import rules - separated into #528  NOTE: We probably have to address the work in this PR https://github.com/UCLALibrary/californica/pull/399/files - i.e. potentially revert it Child of UCLALibrary/ursus#270
