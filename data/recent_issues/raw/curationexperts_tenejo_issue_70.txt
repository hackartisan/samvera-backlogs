Use Darlingtonia? Something else?
STORY As a product owner I would like the team to make a recommendation regarding using Darlingtonia going forward or writing alternative import code so that we can continue moving forward with the self-service importer. Questions to ask  Does Darlingtonia help meet our design goal better than new code? How well does Darlingtonia meet each of our design criteria? Does Darlingtonia prematurely generalize requirements that are not concrete in the problem? (See Sandi Metz - The Wrong Abstraction ) How easily does Darlingtonia support the logging requirements in #72 Importer error reporting  Depends on #74
