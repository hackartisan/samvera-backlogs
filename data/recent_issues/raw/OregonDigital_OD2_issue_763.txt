Clean up 'No Results Found' text/links on empty search result
Descriptive summary The text displayed when there's no search results returned ( http://staging.oregondigital.org/catalog?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_field=all_fields&q=blahblah ) could use some clean up. Especially the last part "you searched by All Fields - try searching everything" which can probably just be removed. 'searching everything' link wouldn't make sense since 'All Fields' is designed to do that. This goes to a search link hitting the 'contained_in_journal' field. Also phrasing mismatch with "No entries found" and "No results found..." Expected behavior When no search results are found, helpful tips and other options are displayed.
