Can't add new content via UI
ISSUES I'm no longer able to add a new item to the repository via the user interface.  I was definitely able to create two items successfully prior to the upgrade. STEPS TO REPRODUCE  Login (use an administrator account to see sidekiq errors in future steps) Visit the "Your Works" tab on the dashboard Click the "Add new work" button Choose "Publication" as the work type and click the "Create new work" button Give the work a title, attach a file, check the deposit agreement, and click the "Save" button  EXPECTED RESULT My new work appears with a thumbnail of the file I attached. ACTUAL RESULT The work appears, but there is no thumbnail associated, and multiple jobs are retrying due to errors in Sidekiq (i.e. check out https://cypripedium-cd.curationexperts.com/sidekiq/retries) ACCEPTANCE   I can create new works via the UI with files correctly attached
