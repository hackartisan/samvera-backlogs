Imported works do not show as members of a collection
After importing works via bag+csv, the display page for the collection does not list the contained works. The problem seems to be that the alternate_id property is used for the member_of_collection_ids field. The link between work and collection is correctly made: the work points to the collection. However, the inverse query in Collection::WithMembers doesn't seem to find the contained works within the collection. TODO:  additional testing of imported collections to verify display of works verify existing collection feature tests include display of works
