Workflow - Accession
Story As a Library Staff Depositor, Collection Manager or Preservation Curator, I want to use a preservation workflow interface with logging capabilities for Accession workflow activities, so that I can record context and information about the determination and process of adding the material to the repository for long term preservation Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes Multiple standard workflows relating to different repository lifecyle points were identified by the Digital Preservation FRG. A workflow is a series of collected Events, along with optional human-entered notes. This epic identifies UI and event details for Accessioning (the stage in which a depositor is preparing the material for ingest, in other words, is populating the Curate Deposit form and then hits Submit). For v.1 implementation, some Ingest Workflow Events have been moved to Accessioning related to what we think Hyrax and Fedora will do sequentially. Links to Additional Information Approved Preservation Events & Workflows Preservation - Metadata Properties Needed Preservation Log - XML Mockup File & FileSet/Technical Metadata List of all Preservation UI Mockups  Add Accession metadata as part of Create Work See completed workflow summary and Preservation Log details Revise metadata for a completed workflow  Checklist   Accession workflow is incorporated into the Create Work interface  Standard Workflow metadata is recorded  Standard Events metadata is recorded for Events that run as part of the Workflow   Metadata extraction (object level, from Curate form, CSV, or Alma) Policy Assignment (assignment of rights/visibility level) Metadata extraction (files/FITS) Format identification (files/FITS) Validation (files/FITS) Message digest calculation Virus check (if successful: failures will be hard to capture)    Users can supply optional rights information or notes related to the Workflow occurrence  Events are executed in a sequence driven by their dependencies [exact order TBD]  Some Events may need to run more than once (e.g. Metadata Extraction Events)  When completed, Accession information can be viewed in the Curate UI to selected users  Additional instances of Accession can occur, in order to allow a user to correct/update information about why the material was added to the repository  Given/When/Then  Given (some context) and (some other optional context) When (some action is carried out) Then (a set of observable consequences should occur)
