use Darlingtonia::LogStream?
looks like darlingtonia provides functionality similar to our Spot::StreamLogger (https://github.com/curationexperts/darlingtonia/blob/master/lib/darlingtonia/log_stream.rb). there are some differences (i like that it writes to a separate file; i'm not crazy about the file names it picks), so perhaps we just need to cherry-pick?
