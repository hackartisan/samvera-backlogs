Additional or Quality Metadata for Google Scholar (aka, The Scholar)
We need to rework the metadata per the recommendations from Google in regards to scholarly literature.  https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#indexing Place each article and each abstract in a separate HTML or PDF file Use Dublin Core tags (e.g., DC.title) as a last resort Only scholarly papers are appropriate for inclusion in Google Scholar; each paper needs to be listed on a separate URL; and at least the full author-written abstract must be clearly visible on the URL that you wish to be included in Google Scholar search results.  Example Work that we would want to be indexed https://scholarsphere.psu.edu/concern/generic_works/xwd375x69k Datasets should be found in Google Dataset Search. https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/dataset
