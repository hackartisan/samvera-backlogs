Creating a batch of works without files throws an error
Descriptive summary If you try to use batch create and only fill out the metadata (don't upload any files) Scholar will let you attempt to save the batch, but it will then throw an error: NoMethodError in Hyrax::BatchUploadsController#create undefined method `permit!' for nil:NilClass  I suspect that the config.work_requires_files = false in config/initializers/hyrax.rb is probably affecting both single works and batch works.  That is, we currently have Scholar configured to allow saving of batches without files. We want users to be able to create single works without files, but at least one file should be required for batch works. We probably need to tweak https://github.com/uclibs/ucrate/blob/develop/app/views/hyrax/base/_form_progress.html.erb#L11 so that it always requires files when batch create is being used. This is probably a bug in Hyrax.  We should fix it in our app for the moment, but also check to see if there is an existing bug filed in Hyrax.  If not, open and issue and potentially submit the fix there as well.
