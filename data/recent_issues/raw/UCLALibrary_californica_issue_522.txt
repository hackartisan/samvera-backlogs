Document actor stack actions
As a project team member, I would like to have a detailed understanding of what each part of the actor stack does related to import. Approval criteria   A document exists that briefly documents the different actions that take place inside each actor during the import process.  For example, when do derivative files get created during import. See https://docs.library.ucla.edu/display/CUP/Californica+CSV+Importer+Notes. Related to #423
