Subject-geographic: QA vocab no longer loads for auto-completes 
Describe the bug When populating objects in the last week or so, the Subject-Geographic field no longer loads the GeoNames vocabulary. Other vocabs from LC are working. To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior:  Create a new work or edit an existing work Click on the Additional Fields button to show all fields Scroll down to to Subject - Geographic Begin slowly typing a common location such as "Atlanta" No values are suggested while you are typing  Expected behavior When I type three or more letters, a series of suggested terms appear in a drop box beneath the field. Screenshots  Desktop (please complete the following information):  OS: Mac OS Mojave Browser: Safari Version 12.1.1  Additional context Timing-wise, I noticed this in our AWS@emory environment. When I did acceptance testing on controlled vocabs earlier, it was in our local AWS environment.
