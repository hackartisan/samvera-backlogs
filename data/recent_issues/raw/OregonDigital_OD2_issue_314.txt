Rails 5.2 support
Descriptive summary Rails 5.2 now includes support for ActiveStorage. This integration would be nice for OregonDigital/hyrax-migrator#26 Expected behavior With Rails 5.2 installed, we can follow the guide to setup ActiveStorage (one of the new features) at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html Related work  So far, I have a branch https://github.com/OregonDigital/OD2/compare/rails-5.2-support and attempted to upgrade Rails to 5.2.2 with:  bundle exec rake app:update bundle update rails  But, I got hyrax was resolved to 2.4.0, which depends on       hydra-works (< 2.0, >= 0.16) was resolved to 1.0.0, which depends on         hydra-pcdm (>= 0.9) was resolved to 1.0.0, which depends on           activesupport (< 5.2)      rails (~> 5.2.2) was resolved to 5.2.2, which depends on       activesupport (= 5.2.2)  It looks like at this point, one of the dependencies (hydra-pcdm) doesn't support Rails 5.2, and there is a related open ticket at samvera/hydra-pcdm#264  Rails diff between Rails 5.1.6 (current recommended version in Hyrax) and 5.2.0: http://railsdiff.org/5.1.6/5.2.0
