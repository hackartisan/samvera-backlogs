Titles importing from finding aids with parent components
I'm currently scanning and uploading materials from the Scribner's author files for Edith Wharton.  When I tried to add C0101_001956, C0101_001957, and C0101_001971  to Figgy, I saw that the unit titles of parent components were being included along with those of child components, instead of just having the title of the child component. (see: https://figgy.princeton.edu/catalog/ba584d93-948e-4e14-98d7-422a52c29488, https://figgy.princeton.edu/catalog/151d5edb-6e34-443d-b759-1e722f3e1f17, https://figgy.princeton.edu/catalog/31b3edd2-b8b3-4ef3-a92d-2fdf53ef74cd) reported by Squirrel. Please let Squirrel and Faith know when this is resolved. this is similar to #1444 which was resolved. need to look into why it's happening again.
