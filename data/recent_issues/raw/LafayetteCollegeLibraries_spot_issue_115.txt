issue ingesting ppt(x) files
when ingesting LDR items, one thing that consistently gets hung up is item 448, which consists of 6 slideshow presentations. these get stuck in the CreateDerivativesJob portion of the ingest, which is creating thumbnails by first converting the document to a pdf and then generating a thumbnail from that file (see: https://github.com/samvera/hydra-derivatives/blob/d6847f7/lib/hydra/derivatives/processors/document.rb for the processor, and https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/blob/5a9d1be16ee1a9150646384471992b03aab527a5/app/services/hyrax/file_set_derivatives_service.rb#L61-L69 for the parameters being passed) i've tried running the command manually (via soffice) and was successful in generating the pdf. next step might be to try running the hydra-derivatives code from a rails console and see if that works. i have a sneaking suspicion that trying to use multiple instances of libreoffice is causing this to fail locally (the whole app is spun up) and am curious to see if it causes the same problems on the server.
