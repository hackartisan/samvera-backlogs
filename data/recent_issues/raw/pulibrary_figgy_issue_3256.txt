Determine whether we will support other legacy bag structures
via email from @kellybolding,  C1372 has extra folders for each barcode, which is not currently accommodated by our bag ingest code C1557 follows a different naming convention  Should we ask for these to be updated or make tickets to accommodate these structures?
