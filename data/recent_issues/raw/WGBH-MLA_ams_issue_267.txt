Descriptions and Title are getting mapped during Zipped XML ingest
Some descriptions and titles are coming in and some aren't. I can't tell right now if the discrepancy is based on descriptionType and titleType or what. The weirdest part is that in the search results, the description will appear, but then it won't be in the Asset Details section of the record's show page. ** this might be a separate issue where titles and descriptions (and maybe dates) with no type (so the generic Asset.description) are not getting displayed on the asset show page. Example: For this GUID, cpb-aacip_169-440rz2r4, the Episode Title and Episode Description came through, but the Series title comes through with no type.
