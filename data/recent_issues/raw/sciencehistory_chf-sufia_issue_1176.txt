Some PDF thumbnail generations failing silently 
Some PDFs, including https://digital.sciencehistory.org/works/2z10wr24q, failed to generate a thumbnail when uploaded. We did not receive a honeybadger error for this failure. When @eddierubeiz did a manual regeneration the thumbnail appeared correctly. The log on the jobs server does show it attempting to make the derivatives for this work.
