Export metadata as CSV
Descriptive summary As part of #644, a work should be able to export its metadata to a temporary CSV file. The first row should be headers of the human readable names for each metadata entry. The data should be one row of metadata. Edit from conversation with Kate: Multivalue metadata should be a quotes escaped list of values, separated by | (bars/pipes). Labels for CVs should not be provided, just URIs. Both labels and URIs should be present for CVs. Use the standard CSV library to avoid issues with the CSV spec: https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.1/libdoc/csv/rdoc/CSV.html And if you still think the format looks off, check the RFC: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180 Expected behavior A work can provide a file pointer to a temporary CSV metadata export. The CSV file is formatted to RFC4180. For now, ignore file clean up and we'll deal with it in a separate issue (#667). Related work Child of #644 Accessibility Concerns None
