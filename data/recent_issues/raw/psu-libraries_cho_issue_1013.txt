Data transformation labels
Description Current display transformations take a field/value pair and render them using custom html. This removes the field from the definition list. We don't have the ability to transform the value while leaving the field in the definition list with its transformed value. This would need to occur in both search result (index) and full metadata (show) pages. Done When... If I choose "registered" for :access_rights, then I should see "PSU Access" in the display pages. Issues  should the transformation be indexed, enabling the user to search on the transformed term instead of the persisted one? users need to change the transformed values without developer intervention
