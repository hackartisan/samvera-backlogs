Discuss a migration process for bumping postgres from 10 to 11
Descriptive summary At some point in the future, we should probably bump to the newest version of postgres. This would have to be done by having either: A) Two containers up. One with Postgres 10 and one with postgres 11. OR B) we install Postgres 11 on the container with Postgres 10 and run the migration script there. ORRRRR C) We blow away the data in the postgres 10 db and just start fresh with Postgres 11 This migration works similarly to what Fedora's migration path looks like between fedora 3 and fedora 4. There is already a script that exists found here https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/pgupgrade.html This would get us up to date with the newest version of postgres. We may want to decide to do this before we migrate and upload seed data onto the staging server, or if we do it after, we would have to migrate following the above steps described in their docs.
