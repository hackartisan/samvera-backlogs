Workflow - Ingest
Story As a Library Staff Depositor, Collection Manager or Preservation Curator, I want to use a preservation workflow interface with logging capabilities for Ingest workflow activities, so that I can supply notes relevant to an ingest, such as re-ingest or migration context Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes In v.1, for Ingest, there will not be a UI component for initiating Ingest, because it will be triggered by the Create Work (Accession) workflow. Ingest will be tracked as the actions from Hyrax to Fedora and to storage. Confirm: can you revisit/modify workflow metadata about an Ingest? Links to Additional Information Approved Preservation Events & Workflows Preservation - Metadata Properties Needed Preservation Log - XML Mockup File & FileSet/Technical Metadata List of all Preservation UI Mockups Checklist   Record record standard events/workflow metadata  Ingest workflow initiates the following v.1 Events:   Validation (AIP created for the whole object) Replication (files replicated in S3) Fixity [if run as part of ingest]    Completed workflow summary information displays on Preservation Summary views in the Curate UI  Given/When/Then  Given (some context) and (some other optional context) When (some action is carried out) Then (a set of observable consequences should occur)
