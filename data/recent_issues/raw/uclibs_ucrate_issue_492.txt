Fix IIIF viewer problem on scholar-dev.uc.edu
Descriptive summary (This will require someone with access to the scholar-dev servers) The image viewer works fine when run locally, but on scholar-dev.uc.edu the viewer always displays "Not Found" when it tries to display images.  Scholar-dev is running in development mode just like on our laptops.  So it's not a development/production problem. It could be a path issue. You can try changes directly on the scholar-dev server, but any changes to our repository should be made after #491 has been merged.  That's the branch that's running on scholar-dev right now.
