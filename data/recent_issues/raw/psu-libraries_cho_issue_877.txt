Clicking Show on Edit Form (Without Changes) Throws Error
Clicking Show at the bottom of the edit form on collections and works returns a page not found error. It seems the link just drops edit from the URL, but it should be replacing works|archival-collection|library-collection with catalog too. This: https://cho-qa.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/3d4ef4b6-0fe7-405e-a3e6-94990f816006 Instead of this: https://cho-qa.libraries.psu.edu/works/3d4ef4b6-0fe7-405e-a3e6-94990f816006
