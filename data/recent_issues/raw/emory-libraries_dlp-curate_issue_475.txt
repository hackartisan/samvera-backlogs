File transfers for Langmuir
Discussed in standup:  start testing out file transfers for Langmuir collection. Consult with Kyle Fenton for more information about the NAS location and directory structure. Here is a sample complete file path for a Langmuir image: ::nasn2dmz.cc.emory.edu:dmfiles:MARBL:Manuscripts:MSS_1218_Langmuir:ARCH:B038:MSS1218_B038_I038_P0001_ARCH.tif Additional notes from Kyle about NAS directories A full transfer for the image files should contain 45,641 TIFF files   Request access to NAS Directory  connect to NAS directory for DAMS: Langmuir collection  incorporate fixity checking as part of transfer (use rsync, MD5 or SHA1)*  record any fixity failures  record any transfer failures  transfer files to the existing EFS, mirroring directory structure of NAS.  Report on speed of working with EFS vs EBS.  This CSV is a partial list of the Langmuir files and includes a column called "Path" for the files to transfer: https://emory.app.box.com/file/501227444677 Additional file list for "_PROD" versions of files *this is part of our acceptance criteria with stakeholders
