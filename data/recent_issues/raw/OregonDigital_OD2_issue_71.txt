[1] Configure GenericWork to have a triple powered field.
Descriptive summary Here, we need to make sure to include all the objects in the proper places around the app and actually test if labels are being fetched, indexed, and viewable from the show page. https://github.com/osulp/Scholars-Archive/pull/564/files#diff-e11bdaf9116be3911e9557b69e242370 The objects that need files included can be found here and found by a simple ctrl-f look for include Then after all the proper files have been included in the proper places, then you can ingest a work, input a uri such as http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85145447 in the form and it should display "water" as the label. This will conclude the triplestore configuration and show that triple powered properties and the backend are all working properly. Expected behavior Generate a work with a uri in the proper field and it should display its label.
