DOI intentifer_url fields still have EZID domains
Descriptive summary work.identifier_url for works that had DOIs before our migration still have EZID domains in them.  Example: https://ezid.cdlib.org/id/doi:10.7945/C2R11X Those fields should be modified to use https://api.datacite.org/dois/10.7945/C2R11X The incorrect URL is preventing users from editing their existing works with DOIs.
