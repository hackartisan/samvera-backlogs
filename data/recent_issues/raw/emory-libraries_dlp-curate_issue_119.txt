Edit/manage AIP FileSets
Story As a Preservation Curator, I want to view and edit File Sets assigned to the overall object package, so that I can manage the preservation package's files over time Acceptance Criteria Use one or more of the following options to provide acceptance criteria. Notes Relates #127 and #22 (creating and categorizing File Sets); to #96 (labeling individual preservation files). This epic focuses on how to edit File Sets that have already been created and assigned to a Work. The interface for editing a File Set can largely be re-used from the Create interface, but we will also need to add the ability to re-order File Sets in a work as well as to delete File Sets from a work. Some work has been re-scoped to an enhancement epic #349 to do post-migration.
