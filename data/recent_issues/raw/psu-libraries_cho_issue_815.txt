Batch Import Broken
Data dictionary field Identifier (display name) has the label alternate_ids as of 2018-10-08. When this label is used as the column heading for CSV in batch import, an error message is shown: Unexpected columns(s): 'alternate_ids'. In Slack, @cam156 suggested: "It is possible the schemas were not updated to include the change to core fields." I tested prior labels for this field (identifier, identified, and Identifier) to see if I could complete a batch import to be able to give a product demonstration to stakeholders. I received the same Unexpected column(s) error message every time.
