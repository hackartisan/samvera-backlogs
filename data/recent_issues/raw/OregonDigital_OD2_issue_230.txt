Figure out notification and email policy
Descriptive summary Hyrax, by default, does not send emails to users. Instead, they use the mailboxer gem to send in-app notifications. ScholarsArchive configured mailboxer to send emails to users when they receive a notification: https://github.com/osulp/Scholars-Archive/blob/master/config/initializers/mailboxer.rb Expected behavior Decisions made on:   Should we do the same for OD2?  Can we configure mailboxer to only send emails on certain notifications?  Who should be emailed under what conditions? (workflow change, oEmbed errors, new user, etc)  Related work Simplifies #77 Discussion and discovery on PR #221 Relevant work on SA: https://github.com/osulp/Scholars-Archive/search?q=mailboxer&unscoped_q=mailboxer Hyrax documentation about notifications/emails: https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/wiki/Hyrax-Management-Guide#notifications - should be noted, the only mention of ActionMailer in code is for the contact form
