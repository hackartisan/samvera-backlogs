Configure Coveralls Reporting
ISSUE Coverage data is being generated during CircleCI builds, but we need to configure CircleCI properly in order to send that data to Coveralls.  ACCEPTANCE   Set the COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN environment token in CircleCI docs   Go to https://coveralls.io/github/emory-libraries/dlp-curate/settings and look up the "Repo Token" (DCE doesn't have access to do this)  Go to https://circleci.com/gh/emory-libraries/dlp-curate/edit#env-vars and create a new environment variable with the name COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN and the value you just looked up in Coveralls
