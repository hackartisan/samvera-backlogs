Homepage accessibility: search box button label
Descriptive summary The dropdown in the search box (pre-filter for 'all works,' 'osu content,' 'uo content,' etc) does not provide a sufficiently descriptive label. Currently, the label is the default value "All." The label should describe the expected input. Expected behavior Searchbox dropdown is labeled as 'collection,' 'scope,' 'filter,' or similar. Related work Audit from #697 Accessibility Concerns Labels provide screen readers with hints to announce to the users what the purpose of a form element is. Without a label, the user is left to guess what the element is supposed to do by the context of the possible values (if a mediated field), previous elements, element type, and form function.
