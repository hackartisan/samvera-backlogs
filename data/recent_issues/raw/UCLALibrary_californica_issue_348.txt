Fix accessibility issues on search results

Example search results page: https://ursus-stage.library.ucla.edu/catalog?f%5Bsubject_sim%5D%5B%5D=People  [ ]Thumbnails on this page do not  give the title of the image in the alt tag EXAMPLE <img src="http://californica-stage.library.ucla.edu//downloads/m326m172d?file=thumbnail" alt="M326m172d?file=thumbnail">  An example of accessible thumbnail images in a search results page, can be found in the database ARTSTOR. EXAMPLE <img _ngcontent-c14="" aria-role="image" id="LICHTENSTEIN_10313550878" src="//mdxdv.artstor.org/thumb/imgstor/size1/licht/d0001/licht_m-0087_as_8b_srgb.jpg" alt="Thumbnail of Cherry Pie by Lichtenstein, Roy (American painter, sculptor, and printmaker, 1923-1997)" aria-label="Thumbnail of Cherry Pie by Lichtenstein, Roy (American painter, sculptor, and printmaker, 1923-1997)" title="Thumbnail of Cherry Pie by Lichtenstein, Roy (American painter, sculptor, and printmaker, 1923-1997)">
