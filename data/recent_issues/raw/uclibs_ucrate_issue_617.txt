Solr reindex_everything times out
Descriptive summary Running ActiveFedora::Base.reindex_everything on the console on scholar.uc.edu times out after several minutes. I've put a temporary fix on scholar.uc.edu and successfully reindexed, but I'm opening this issue to track the problem and to get the fix permanently committed to the repository. The fix:   Override lib/active_fedora/fedora.rb (from active_fedora 11.5.4) with the changes in https://github.com/samvera/active_fedora/pull/1271/files#diff-b3c26f8181d0cf72cfabefe200627084   Add request: { timeout: 600, open_timeout: 60} to each section of config/fedora.yml (see samvera/active_fedora#1105 (comment))   Pin active-fedora to 11.5.4 in the Gemfile so our override stays valid.   We shouldn't need this fix anymore after we are on active-fedora 12.x.
