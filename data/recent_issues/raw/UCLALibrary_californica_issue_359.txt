Trial Ingest Will Connell Collection into Californica Dev
As a greedy product owner, I am eager to see a second collection in Californica and Ursus to test the work we've done so far and see how the work done so far fits with a new collection. Metadata is available here: https://ucla.box.com/s/m10c18njhkrchwpxt1tm69h0ejskgg2v Lisa and Stephen will need to coordinate copying the master images to a mount point. Copy masters from Netapp masters location to mount point for inngest into Samvera: \svm-netapp-dlib.in.library.ucla.edu\Masters\dlmasters\connell\image Acceptance Criteria   A full attempt to load all 503 objects from the Will Connell collection into Californica-dev took place  Notes of findings, errors, lessons-learned are made on this ticket
