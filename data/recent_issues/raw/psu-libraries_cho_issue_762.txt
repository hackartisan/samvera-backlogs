Display text from a selected datalist element
When using datalist attributes for collection members or roles, the value is displayed after selection. Ex: <option value="http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/adp">Adapter</option> We'd like to see "Adapter" shown, but what happens currently is the URI is displayed.
