Restore californica-test environment to samtest
Preparation:   Create all-in-one restore environment samtest.library.ucla.edu  Put californica-test in read-only mode  Copy fedora-data from californica-test  Backup MySQL database  Backup Solr  Backup Redis  Backup Derivatives Read-only mode was enabled for all of the above steps. The copy of fedora-data was taken from a NetApp snapshot generated during the quiescent (read-only) state. How can we determine if the component parts are in a self-consistent state?  Restore:    Restore all data/databases to samtest    Does logging appear normal during start-up?    Does the visual comparison of https://samtest.library.ucla.edu/ (not-secure but safe) with https://californica-test.library.ucla.edu/ look correct?    Reviewer - Bess 🎉 🍾    Reviewer - Jen 🐸    Other reviewer - Mark   ** Keep in mind that Californica code base for samtest is March 18, 2019 and californica-test is April 8, 2019. We are concerned with internal content integrity, not layout or difference in function as result of the version difference.
