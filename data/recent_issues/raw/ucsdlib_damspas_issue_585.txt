Delete 57 curator-only objects in James Stewart Papers collection
Descriptive summary Request to delete 57 curator-only objects in the James Stewart Papers collection approved by Roger Smith. Rationale Laurel McPhee: The James Stewart Papers collection has 57 items that were suppressed to curator-only because at the time we did not have permission to delete. Can you create a ticket to move forward with deleting those objects? They were re-appraised when the paper portion of the collection was processed. Anything that is public should remain.
