Re-index all the Work records in Production
This requires pieces in Ursus to be working. Subsequent to #406, and as a prerequisite to using arks in Ursus urls, we need to reindex all our server environments Run the rake task on the environments to re-index all the Work records  Use Jenkins to deploy $ ssh deploy@californica-prod [deploy@p-w-californicaweb01 ~]$ cd /opt/californica/current [deploy@p-w-californicaweb01 current]$ RAILS_ENV=production nohup bundle exec rake reindex 2>&1 > reindex.log & [deploy@p-w-californicaweb01 current]$ tail -f reindex.log  Acceptance â€“ all environments have been reindexed so that the single-valued solr field ark-ssi is available for use in Ursus urls:   californica-production Log
