SPIKE: How do we handle CSV files
Something to consider about file cleanup:  Make sure we don't accidentally delete our CSV manifests for CSV imports. In Hyrax, attached files are uploaded as Hyrax::UploadedFile records, and the files are stored in the Hyrax.config.upload_path.  These are considered temporary files because when all the background jobs have finished ingesting those files into fedora, we no longer need them.  Normally those background jobs would finish in just a few minutes, so I think most of our production environments just clean up all files older than N days. But, now we are storing a different type of file.  The CSV manifests aren't temporary files.  They are the permanent storage location for CSV files that are attached to a CsvImport record.  We want to keep those files for as long as the corresponding CsvImport records exist. So, there are a couple ways you could handle it...  When you clean up the Hyrax uploads dir, make sure you exclude the sub-directory where the CSV files are stored.  That sub-directory is set by default here: https://github.com/curationexperts/tenejo/blob/master/app/uploaders/csv_manifest_uploader.rb#L48  or:  Set an environment variable CSV_MANIFESTS_PATH to store the CSV files somewhere outside of the Hyrax uploads dir.
