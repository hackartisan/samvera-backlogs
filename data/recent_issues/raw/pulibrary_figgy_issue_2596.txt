Support bulk reindexing jobs for GeoBlacklight
Currently, Figgy only publishes GeoBlacklight messages for bulk updates when the BULK env. variable is set (or, alternatively, when a user invokes the needed Rake command and explicitly sets this).  This is found within https://github.com/pulibrary/figgy/blob/master/app/services/event_generator/geoblacklight_event_generator.rb#L65.  Also, perhaps https://github.com/pulibrary/figgy/blob/master/app/services/geo_resource_reindexer.rb could be generalized and a new class for bulk indexing could be introduced? Please see pulibrary/pulmap#599 (comment) for context.
