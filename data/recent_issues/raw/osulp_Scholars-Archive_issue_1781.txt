Fix predicate for :conference_section
Descriptive summary The predicate for conference_section got changed and needs to be corrected (...w2id.org... should be ...w3id.org...) Not sure how it got changed, but it was by me when the conference predicates were moved to default metadata: c7f6045#diff-1e841b2558a016e0f500e5866610cb70R42 Works with the old predicate will not have that data show up if edited and saved or reindexed. Expected behavior conference_section predicate is https://w3id.org/scholarlydata/ontology/conference-ontology.owl#Track Actual behavior conference_section predicate is https://w2id.org/scholarlydata/ontology/conference-ontology.owl#Track Related work #1782 - Replace predicate on all works needed
