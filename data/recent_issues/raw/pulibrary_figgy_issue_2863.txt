Questions / potential refactors for BrowseEverything::Parameters
It might be nice to extract methods for just the files and just the directories here: https://github.com/jrgriffiniii/browse-everything/blob/252bd8504086be0281ad38c04996cbb231371a50/app/controllers/concerns/browse_everything/parameters.rb#L12-L23   Related to the above, there's already a selected_files method, which I think gets all selected files and all files within selected directories. It would be nice to have a version that just gets directly-selected files, and of course important to name them clearly.   Why on line 15 does it default to an array but on line 36 to a hash? It seems like we would expect one or the other https://github.com/jrgriffiniii/browse-everything/blob/252bd8504086be0281ad38c04996cbb231371a50/app/controllers/concerns/browse_everything/parameters.rb#L15 https://github.com/jrgriffiniii/browse-everything/blob/252bd8504086be0281ad38c04996cbb231371a50/app/controllers/concerns/browse_everything/parameters.rb#L36
