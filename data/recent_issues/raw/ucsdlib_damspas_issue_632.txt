Re-ordering of DAMS elements in the UI
From dams-metadata created by hjsyoo: ucsdlib/dams-metadata#56 Summary Proposing a re-ordering of DAMS elements, as listed in the second column of https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n7REAqpt2vh_BQWXFhTbAyVQY5kI7JPOuBAhg8WYTmU/edit#gid=0. Prior to re-ordering, a new field, Cite This Work, is proposed: ucsdlib/damsmanager#368 Rationale Currently, the various Note types in the ranking are broken up by the Subject types, into two rough groupings. This means that many of the notes that are important to Research Data Collections appear after Subjects, which can be extensive. This pushes important information such as Related Publications and Technical Details toward the bottom of the page. Subjects are more likely to be used in order to navigate away from the current page (i.e., to find similar objects), whereas note information can be critical to understanding the data that are available on the current landing page.
