Request production access to AWS SES (email) services
Right now we are in the sandbox and can only deliver to approved addresses. Requesting production access will allow us to send email to addresses that haven't been manually approved: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/request-production-access.html   Sending an email for the password reset form is sucessful for non-approved email addresses
