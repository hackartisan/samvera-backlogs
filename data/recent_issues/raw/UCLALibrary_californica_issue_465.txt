Load Bennett Collection
As a library staff member, I'd like to see more collections added to the new digital library system. Please load the new collection (Bennett). As a project member, I would also like to refine and test the documentation available here:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fKk9iXXU6YE0URV1d5qxxOJ5UsG5RbpUbpnMo4oeHdA/edit?usp=sharing.  (Developed under #361) There are many steps to this process and different people needed for each one.  See the child tickets for details.
