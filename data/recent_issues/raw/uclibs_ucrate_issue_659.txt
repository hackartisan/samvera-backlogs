Generate all work types with content in all fields for testing
Descriptive summary For testing and QA purposes, it would be nice if we could easily generate a work of every work type with content in all fields. Update the db:seed task to also generate 8 works (one of each type)  All fields should be completed.  The content in each field should make it obvious what that field is (e.g. for Time Period enter something like "time period") Multi-valued fields should have more than one value entered Have the manydeposits user own these works  The task should also create a collection with all metadata fields completed and the 8 works above should be added to that collection.
