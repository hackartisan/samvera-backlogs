Imported provenance in scanned map causes errors
A scanned map with an imported provenance causes the related document to have incorrect slugs in Pulmap: https://figgy.princeton.edu/catalog/31e8ac56-abcb-4462-9272-2c72dabd82b4 https://maps.princeton.edu/catalog/historic-maps-copy-has-stamp-of-map-divison-library-of-congress-dated-jul-2-1887-mp48sg69x We use Provenance in Figgy to store the base of Pulmap of slug. The record above should be indexed as .../princeton-mp48sg69x. There is a conflict with the property name. We should probably create a new property for this information. held_by maybe?
