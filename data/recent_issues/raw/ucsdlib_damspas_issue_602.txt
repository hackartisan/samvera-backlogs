Recreate CLR for Scripps Research Expeditions
Descriptive summary Reconstruct the CLR for the  Scripps Research Expeditions. Add missing data, fix data links, make sure CLR thumbnail appears, re-index, etc. Note: dams:corporateName <mads:CorporateName rdf:about="http://library.ucsd.edu/ark:/20775/bb27660034"> ... should be carried into all objects for this collection. Rationale The collection level record for the Scripps Research Expeditions was stripped of many data elements when Ho Jung's student was using the DOI update function. Since then Longshou has updated the code and pushed through a PR. The CLR needs to be reconstructed (data links and all) and fixed.
