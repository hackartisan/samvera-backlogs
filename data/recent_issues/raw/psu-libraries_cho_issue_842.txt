ISO 8601 and EDTF Merging in ISO 8601-2019 Revision
ISO 8601 is undergoing revision and merging in EDTF. After the new standard is published we should monitor upstream dependencies for changes impacting CHO.  ISO 8601 is currently undergoing a revison to be published mid 2019. There will be two parts: ISO 8601-2019 Part 1 and ISO 8601-2019 Part 2. Part 1 is essentially the same as 8601-2004 (with some corrections). Part 2 is extensions. All of the features of EDTF are supported by Part 2, and in addition, the EDTF specification (this specification) is included as a profile of ISO 8601. An earlier draft specification (pre-submission) was issued in 2012. The full functionality of the draft specification is retained, however several syntactic changes were necessary, to satisfy international requirements. https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/edtf.html
