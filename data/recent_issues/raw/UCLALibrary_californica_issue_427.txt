Enable Librarians to select representative image for a collection
As a librarian, I would like to select a representative and effective image to be associated with a collection in any display of that collection level record. This image will act as a visual proxy for the collection. I would like to do this activity through the staff web interface. Acceptance Criteria As a logged in user with admin privileges   There is a workflow / UI to allow me to associate an image from the collection with the collection level record  After selecting the representative image, I can view the search results that include the collection level record and see the thumbnail of the image I selected  After selecting the image, I can change my selection if I decide I don't like it
