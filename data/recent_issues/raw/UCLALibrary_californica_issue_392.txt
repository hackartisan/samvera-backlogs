Privacy Badger blocks access to IIIF manifests hosted on Californica
As an external researcher, I would like to utilize some of the images hosted on Californica, and embed an IIIF image viewer (such as Universal Viewer or Mirador) on my own web site. However, the very common privacy plugin from EFF, known as Privacy Badger, blocks access to the manifest file hosted on Californica, and thus prevents my site from utilizing the images hosted on Californica. Link which demonstrates the issue (note, you'll need to have Privacy Badger installed in your browser): https://universalviewer.io/uv.html?manifest=https://californica.library.ucla.edu/concern/works/d504rk335/manifest If you enable a developer console, you'll see an error similar to this one:  Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://californica.library.ucla.edu/concern/works/d504rk335/manifest. (Reason: CORS request did not succeed).[Learn More]  More info on CORS: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS More info on Privacy Badger: https://www.eff.org/privacybadger/faq#How-does-Privacy-Badger-work A similar bug report for another project: nolanlawson/pinafore#23 AND, the likely solution: https://www.eff.org/dnt-policy If we place the EFF DNT Policy text file in a .well-known/dnt-policy.txt file on the Californica site, Privacy Badger should stop blocking access to the manifest file.
