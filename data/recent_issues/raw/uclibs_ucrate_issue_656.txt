Resolve time limit problems on Travis
Descriptive summary Our test suite has started hitting the 50 minute time limit on Travis.  So we need to find a way to avoid that timeout. One possible solution is to break our test suite into 2 different groups (probably features specs and then all the rest of the specs).  I think Travis will grant 50 minutes to each grouping. We did something similar to this in https://github.com/uclibs/curate.  See an example of a Travis build with multiple spec groups here: https://travis-ci.org/uclibs/curate Also see  https://github.com/uclibs/curate/blob/develop/tasks/curate_tasks.rake#L105-L121 https://github.com/uclibs/curate/blob/develop/.travis.yml#L27-L31  I think we only want 2 groups at this point:  all of the feature specs (spec/features) everything else
