Adjust fieldname for Collections metadata: Related Material - Finding Aid
In the Curate Collection-level metadata, https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17WLINPefxb0cQh2Jgx6H7XnUCDH8Ol1WlKaxtBAGW38/edit#gid=1472024349&range=9:9] was implemented with the fieldname related_material. Its intent is to store a URL which links to an online Finding Aid. This Collection-level fieldname should be adjusted to a distinct name to avoid confusion with the work-level field :related_material, because it has a more specific meaning and uses a distinct predicate. Suggestion change this to :finding_aid_link Relates to epic #75 and other Collection-related tickets: #403; #406; #387
