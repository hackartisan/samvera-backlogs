Admin stats view raising exception in some cases
The actual error here is undefined method gsub' for nil:NilClass`, and it can be traced here: NoMethodError: undefined method `gsub' for nil:NilClass  user.rb  124 to_param(...) [GEM_ROOT]/gems/hyrax-2.5.1/app/models/concerns/hyrax/user.rb:124:in `to_param'  Looks like there is a method being called on a User object that involves a gsub, which is failing. In the past we have seen this when we have users who don't have an email address or some other expected metadata populated. That would be the first thing I'd check.
