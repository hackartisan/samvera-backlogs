Ingest Pathé Baby Films
This is a potential pilot project for video.  These are about 800 black and white film clips, which currently have a custom exhibit site: https://rbsc.princeton.edu/pathebaby/films and a single MARC collection record (https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/10664204). They are silent films, so captions/transcripts are not an issue. They have some interesting structure:  There are about 800 clips, but many of them should be grouped together for playback (each clip is a "chapter") — this may mean ingesting them as several multi-volume works, or creating playlists to group them together for playback The exhibit site has titles and abstracts for each clip — this text should be migrated to DPUL
