Duplicate Identifiers Bug
I accidentally made a duplicate collection for the work, not realizing old data would remain when a new branch was deployed. I assigned the same identifier (alternate_id) for a new collection and CHO didn't complain. The identfier (alternate_id) field maps to the valkyrie property that is supposed to be unique  https://cho-qa.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/763b12bd-2add-4321-a0b8-1afe984cafff https://cho-qa.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/2bff54a4-03e3-4e1a-a171-2d8cc079d6cc
