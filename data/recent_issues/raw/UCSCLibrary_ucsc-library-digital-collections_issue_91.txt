Digital Filename metadata element not displaying
With the last upgrade, the digital filename metadata element is no longer displaying on the work full display page (example: http://digitalcollections.library.ucsc.edu/concern/works/5d86p0780?locale=en).  We need to see this element in order to process Special Collections reproduction requests.  If is something you can restore? Thanks,  Sue
