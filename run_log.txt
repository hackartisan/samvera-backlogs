## Run 1

N=8

### Top terms per cluster:
Cluster 0: github hyrax rb com https app blob samvera master error
Cluster 1: collection collections works work add page metadata items able need
Cluster 2: use add like https need data image work images test
Cluster 3: ingest princeton edu figgy catalog https pudl mets collection jpstroop
Cluster 4: search results advanced facet text page terms date like searching
Cluster 5: file files preservation work metadata fileset upload set csv acceptance
Cluster 6: metadata fields work field form related edit type behavior display
Cluster 7: page user users admin dashboard link add publisher content work

### Notes

We can see princeton tickets have their own cluster (3). Clearly we need to
augment the stopwords list or clean the data beforehand to remove institution-specific terms.

## Run 2

N=16

### Top terms per cluster:
Cluster 0: scholar_uc_legacy uclibs api uc scholar moved descriptive summary large student
Cluster 1: add use need like data field create new date resource

Cluster 13: edu princeton figgy catalog https concern psu http scholarsphere maps
Cluster 14: metadata fields field work uris controlled data use need form
Cluster 15: collection collections works work page add metadata new need able

### Notes

More institutions are represented here.
Individuals begin to show up as well. Need to clean up anything starting with
`@`. Cleaning these may also get rid of some code, where instance variables are
referenced.

We created a cleaner.

### Run 3

Cluster 0: use add need data like hyrax see work new user
Cluster 1: page link user pages download admin publisher view viewer content
Cluster 2: file files work fileset preservation metadata upload set thumbnail csv

Cluster 5: metadata fields field work form related behavior edit use add
Cluster 6: rb error app project_root backtrace line lib 500 honeybadger gems
Cluster 7: collection collections works work add metadata user like need able

### Notes

Need to do stemming.

Cluster 5: page search result link user show : ( ) add
Cluster 6: preservation metadata ) ( event file criterion context workflow object
Cluster 7: '' `` : ( ) ? ingest field > n't

### Notes

Using the NLTK WordNetLemmatizer. Clearly need to get rid of punctuation

## Run 5

Uses a porter stemmer

Top terms per cluster:
Cluster 0: search result page advanc text term user collect thi item
Cluster 1: thi use user need work test add like imag updat
Cluster 2: ingest note migrat collect ping record metadata thi anywher bulk
Cluster 3: date facet sort field rang year thi edtf index modifi
Cluster 4: file upload work thi metadata preserv set version fileset user
Cluster 5: error backtrac line thi info messag fail work test file
Cluster 6: collect work metadata thi user add page need creat like
Cluster 7: page field work thi metadata download link display type item

### Notes:

We put punctuation stripping and stemming into a tokenizer method

It's sort of hard to read some of the stemmed words; especially what is `thi`,
which appears in many clusters?

Try adding the stemmed stopwords back to the stopwords list

## Run 6

Top terms per cluster:
Cluster 0: file upload work version set delet user use csv need
Cluster 1: error page backtrac user line link work messag fail info
Cluster 2: ingest metadata preserv note record file map migrat event collect
Cluster 3: field metadata display valu requir use work data form relat
Cluster 4: search result page advanc user text term collect work item
Cluster 5: use user imag need add download like resourc updat link
Cluster 6: collect work page user add metadata need item object creat
Cluster 7: work test date embargo uri edit need item creat object

## Notes:

We added stemmed stopwords; looks much better.

We'll also try a different lemmatizer:
 - this run with PorterStemmer
 - try with WordNetLemmatizer, which doesn't change any word that's not in its
   dictionary

### Notes:

We are happy!

## Notes

About half of these look like recognizably coherent.
