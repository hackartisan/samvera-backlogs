# Methods

## Selection / inclusion of code repositories

Repositories were included in this analysis if they met the following criteria:

 * Code is hosted on github
 * Code powers an end-user (staff or public) application at a specific
   institution or consortium
 * Code is not in a samvera github organization, i.e. is not already code that
   the community is manintaining collectively
 * Github repository contains 1 or more issues

Consequences of these criteria:

 * Sometimes we weren't able to analyze highly relevant codebases, for example
   Project Surfliner is a valkyrie project currently in development but their
   issues are not on github. Because of the smaller number of valkyrie projects
   this represents a significant lost opportunity

Observations during this process:

 * Sometimes it felt a little sad, wading through a graveyard of unfinished
   projects; ideas never fully realized
 * There are a number of hyrax implementors that are more or less satisfied
   with the stock application or donâ€™t have the developer capacity for continuous
   customization. And a few that are under active development.
